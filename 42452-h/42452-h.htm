<h2>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h2>


<p>The author has to tender his cordial thanks for
the extreme courtesy and for the invaluable assistance
rendered during his stay in the country by the
Uruguayan officials, and by the British Minister
Plenipotentiary, Mr. J. R. Kennedy.</p>

<p>He is desirous of expressing the obligations under
which he has been placed by Mr. C. E. R. Rowland,
British Consul at Montevideo, for general assistance
and information on the seal fisheries; Señor José H.
Figueira, for the description of the aboriginal
tribes; Señor Ramos Montero, for the commercial
technicalities of the pastoral industry; and Mr. V.
Hinde, for the paper on the British railways in
Uruguay.</p>

<p>Thanks are due to a number of British residents,
both in Montevideo and the Campo, greater than
it is possible to enumerate individually. The
author would more especially acknowledge the
courtesy of Messrs. Stapledon, W. J. Maclean, H.
Hall-Hall, C. W. Baine, Temple, R. Booth, Piria,
Adams, R. B. Harwar, L. L. Mercer, Warren, and
J. Storm.</p>

<p>Mr. R. A. Bennett, who accompanied the author
for the purpose of photography, displayed an unremitting
zeal that must be gratefully recognised.
He is responsible for much of the information on
Mercedes, the Swiss colony, and the frontier town
of Rivera.</p>

<p>Uruguay may be described as a republic of comparatively
small dimensions sandwiched in between
the great territories of Argentina and Brazil, and
bounded on the south by the Southern Atlantic Ocean
and the estuary of the River Plate. Its actual area,
72,100 square miles, is less than that of the British
Isles, and thus the Banda Oriental, to use the name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
by which the State is locally known, enjoys the distinction
of being the smallest of the South American
republics. But, although this distinction applies to
actual area, it serves for remarkably little else in
the country. Indeed, an astonishing amount is
packed within the frontiers of Uruguay. In the first
place it is a land where much history has been made.
Secondly, to turn to its industrial assets&mdash;although I
do not intend to deal with the commercial side of
the Republic more fully than can be helped&mdash;it is
a country where many cattle are bred. Lastly, it is
a place in which no less than fifty million pounds
sterling of English money are invested. Thus the
small Republic, as an investment field, ranks third
in importance amongst all the States of South
America, a fact that is realised by remarkably few
outside its own boundaries.</p>

<p>Uruguay and Paraguay are frequently confused
by those quite unfamiliar with South American affairs,
owing to the similarity of the nomenclature. In
actual fact the two countries have very little in
common, save in their political situation. Both
separated themselves from the River Plate Provinces
in the course of the War of Independence, since
which time both have served as buffer States between
Argentina and Brazil. The position of such is seldom
enviable at the best of times. Upon Uruguay it has
worked with an especial degree of hardship, since
even before the days of her independence it was
upon her suffering soil that the too frequent differences
between Spaniard and Portuguese were fought
out.</p>

<p>As to the international jealousies of a later era,
they have not been without their influence upon the
domestic affairs of the central State. Thus on not a
few occasions the result of foreign diplomacy has
been civil war within the boundaries of Uruguay, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
consequences that were necessarily disastrous to the
nation. The Banda Oriental is a land of sunshine,
it is true, but one of shadow too, which is logical
enough, since without the former the latter cannot
obtain. Its metaphorical sunshine is represented by
the undoubted merits of its inhabitants, its temporary
shadows by the circumstances in which they have
found themselves placed.</p>

<p>He would be no real friend of Uruguay who strove
to show that the march of the country has not been
rudely arrested on innumerable occasions. Indeed,
were it not for the conditions that have prevailed
for centuries, the actual forward steps that the
Republic has effected would be far less remarkable
than is in reality the case. The history of Uruguay
reveals a continuous medley of peace and war. Its
swords have been beaten into ploughshares and
welded back again into lethal weapons ere the metal
had cooled from the force of the former operation.</p>

<p>Each series of such transformations, moreover, has
occurred at intervals sufficiently short to destroy
utterly the hopes and prosperity of an ordinary
people. Over and over again the Uruguayans have
strewn the battlefields with their dead; yet during
each interval they have continued to plant the soil
with its proper and more profitable seed. An extraordinary
vitality on the part of the people joined
to the natural wealth of the land have been the
factors by means of which the small Republic has
brushed away the results of its wars as lightly as
though such convulsions were summer showers.</p>

<p>The history of Uruguay reveals an admirable
amount of pure heroism. Apart from the fighting
merits that are inborn and natural to the race, the
most unsympathetic reader of its past pages cannot
deny to it the innumerable instances of self-sacrifice
that were the fruit of loftier ideals. Of the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
vivid battle scenes that were painted in too deadly
an earnest against their neighbours and even amongst
themselves, there are few that are not relieved by
some illuminating act of heroism, for all the utter
ferocity and courage by which these conflicts were
wont to be marked. Uruguay, in fact, was something
of a South American Switzerland; but a Switzerland
bereft of the lofty peaks and mountain tops that
assisted the men of the Cantons against the Austrians,
endowed, moreover, with a more restless and undisciplined
folk of its own. Yet in many respects the
resemblance holds good, and for one reason most
of all. The Orientales rested not until they had won
their freedom. Not once but several times they were
forced to wrest it from the stranger ere it finally
became secure.</p>

<p>At later periods, too, it is not to be denied that
the greater bulk of the neighbouring nations has stood
out remorselessly between Uruguay and the sunlight.
There have been times when the small Republic
has been ground between the great mills of Argentina
and Brazil. Thus her progress&mdash;steady and all but
continuous in spite of the civil wars and revolutions
that have torn her&mdash;has been achieved all but unnoticed
and entirely unapplauded. Europeans, and
many South Americans too, read of the Uruguayan
battlefields and deeds of arms, yet they learn nothing
of the undercurrent of industry that has flowed
onwards all the while beneath the turbulence of the
wild warrings. Nevertheless, this progress has been
very real, and that it must become apparent to the
world before long is certain. Even to the present
day Uruguay amongst nations has remained "a violet
by a mossy stone, half hidden from the eye." To the
ordinary person who passes between Europe and
South America, Montevideo represents little beyond
a whistling station between the two important halts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
at Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro. In justice to
the Banda Oriental's neighbour be it said that this
ignorance does not apply to the actual resident in
Argentina, and least of all to the dwellers in Buenos
Aires. To them the commercial importance and
general attractions of Uruguay and its capital are
well enough known. This interest, however, is merely
local, and fails to extend beyond the familiar radius
of the pleasant little Republic's influence.</p>

<p>Commercially speaking, it is difficult to understand
how the factors that have now arisen to drag the
Banda Oriental from its undeserved oblivion can well
fail in their task. The linking of the country by
railway with Brazil, the influence that the imminent
cessation of the North American beef exportation
is bound to exert upon a stock-breeding country, to
say nothing of the internal progress already referred
to, must undoubtedly result sooner or later in bringing
the gallant little nation into the light of publicity.</p>

<p>A fusion of warring parties, an end of civil strife,
and a strict attention to the less risky and more
profitable business of the day should follow in the
natural sequence of events. Very hale, hearty, and
jovial though he is, it must be admitted that the
Oriental is in deadly earnest when engaged in civil
battle&mdash;as is the case with all who pursue a hobby
to the detriment of a more lucrative occupation.
Yet the substitution of gunshots for the suffrage is
not only expensive, but, from the polling point of
view, unpleasantly devoid of finality.</p>

<p>The distinctions between the political arrangements
of Uruguay and Argentina are curiously marked.
For generations the latter country has been governed
by a succession of groups that have respectively
formed and dissolved without leaving any marked
cleavage in the society of the nation. Strictly speaking,
Argentina possesses neither faction spirit nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
party. Uruguay, on the other hand, is concerned
first and foremost with these very matters of
party.</p>

<p>The history of the Colorados and the Blancos&mdash;the
reds and whites&mdash;would in itself suffice to fill a
volume. Probably in no other part of the world
have the pure considerations of clan triumphed to
such an extent over the general political situation.
Until the present day the line between the rival
camps has been as absolute as that between life
and death. The position of either is immutable.
Neither argument, mode of government, nor the
vicissitudes of state are among the considerations by
which they are affected. A man is born one of
two things&mdash;a Blanco or a Colorado. This birthright,
moreover, is to be exchanged for no mere mess of
pottage; it is valued above the price of life itself.
Such, at all events, has been the creed of the past,
and to a large extent it still holds good, although
the stress of modern influence is just beginning to
leave its mark upon the cast-iron prejudices that are
the relicts of another age.</p>

<p>At the same time, it must not be inferred from
this that the Uruguayan is ignorant or small-minded.
Far from it. Education enjoys an exceptionally high
standard throughout the country, and a most liberal
breadth of view is typical of the nation. This is
readily admitted, and even insisted upon, by
foreigners whose dealings with the native-born
dwellers in the Republic have placed them in a
position to render an accurate judgment. In internal
politics, however, there are prejudices, considerations
of clan, and points of honour that are not to be
gauged from a purely commercial standpoint.</p>

<p>The foreigner in Uruguay is accorded a most
complete liberty, and there are few of these who
have resided for any length of time within its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
frontiers who have not become very truly attached
to the land and its people.</p>

<p>It has frequently been my lot to pass over from
Argentina to Uruguay, arriving at one of the minor
ports that dot the middle reaches of the great river.
But it so happened that I had never landed, bag
and baggage, at the capital until the time came for
a regular and organised spying out of the land. An
incident at the start lent a very pleasing aspect
to the visit. The customs-house officer, in whose
hands lay the fate of the interior of my baggage,
gazed from where it lay piled upon the official
trestle in the direction of its owner. "Inglez?" he
demanded in the curt tone of one in authority. When
I had signified assent he smiled cordially, sketched
with rapid fingers the magic chalk marks upon the
impedimenta, and then motioned me to pass through
the portals with all the honours of customs, locks
unviolated, and straps in repose.</p>

<p>I have not introduced this incident from any
personal motives. It merely affords an instance of
a very genuine courtesy rendered to the nation
through the medium of one of its most humble units.
Yet it is from such attentions to a stranger that the
trend of the general attitude may be gleaned. The
English are not a little addicted to a frank confession
of their unpopularity amongst the South Americans
in general. The attitude may be the result of a
certain pose, since they claim full credit for the
respect that is undoubtedly theirs by right. Nevertheless,
whether imagined or real, the idea obtains.</p>

<p>In Uruguay at the present moment the Englishman
is so obviously <em>not</em> unpopular that it is gratifying
to be able to proclaim the fact. Whatever the
fates may have in store the existing understanding
between the Uruguayans and the British is very
cordial and complete. In words as well as in deeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
it is perhaps advisable to let well alone. Yet it is
satisfactory to reflect that innumerable practical
proofs show that this mutual esteem which has existed
for centuries has never been more firmly grafted
than at the present day. There can be no doubt,
moreover, that the present satisfactory phase is very
largely due to the efforts of Mr. R. J. Kennedy, the
British Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary,
whose tact and conscientious ability have
won for him respect and popularity on the part of
Uruguayans and resident British alike&mdash;a consummation
to which it is the lot of sufficiently few ministers
to attain.</p>

<p>Although internal disturbances may continue to
arise from time to time, the position of Uruguay is
now undoubtedly consolidated to a far greater extent
than has ever been the case in former years. The
nation that sprang into being at the commencement
of the nineteenth century had to contend with
indefinite frontiers at the best of times, and with the
frequent waves of turbulence that swept inwards over
the land from the greater centres of disturbance
without its borders. Now for many decades an undisturbed
peace has characterised the foreign affairs
of the nation, and such differences as have occurred
from time to time with the neighbouring republics
have been settled in an essentially pacific and
reasonable spirit.</p>

<p>A striking instance of this has occurred quite
recently in the case of the vexed question concerning
the delimitation of neutral waters in the River
Plate. The rights affecting a great inland and international
highway are naturally most delicate and
difficult to adjust, as the past history of the entire
river system here has proved on numerous occasions.
In this particular instance had either Uruguay or
Argentina shown any other but a fair and conciliatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
spirit, the consequences cannot fail to have
been serious in the extreme. As it was, the dispute
was brought to a satisfactory and amicable conclusion,
much to the credit of the respective diplomatists
concerned.</p>

<p>For many years now the policy of the Banda
Oriental Government has been practical and
deliberate. In matters of finance extreme caution
has been exercised, and economy in expenditure has
been rigid. The result is now evident in the very
favourable financial position of the Republic, since
it is now endowed with more solid monetary sinews
than has ever been the case before. The nation,
moreover, is free from any excessive expenditure on
its army and navy. Both branches of the service are
on a small scale, and in this moderation Uruguay is
undoubtedly wise; since, although the race possesses
its fighting instincts to the full, the population and
resources of the Republic would not allow it to
compete either in numbers, guns, or ships with the
armies of the neighbouring countries, or with the
great naval armaments that are being brought
together.</p>

<p>In the past there is no doubt that matters in
Uruguay have been regarded with a certain amount
of pessimism&mdash;a gloomy view for which the alleged
instability of the Government was chiefly responsible.
Were all that has been said on this head strictly
accurate, there is no doubt that the condition of
the country would be parlous indeed. On numberless
occasions, however, the reports that have prevailed
have been remarkable merely for their
exaggeration. Frequently, moreover, such highly
coloured&mdash;or rather darkened&mdash;pictures have been
depicted to serve interests in Europe rather than in
Uruguay. Commercially speaking, it is surely a
matter for congratulation that even such a disturbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
element as civil strife should have left the
financial solidity of the Republic unimpaired.</p>

<p>This point of view, however, is merely the financial
one&mdash;important enough in its place, but not sufficiently
overwhelming to eliminate all the other
interests at stake. The spirit of progress has been
abroad, not only in the ethics of the pastures, banks,
and business houses, but in the more subtle fields
of science, literature, and art as well. This, however,
is not the place in which to introduce details
or statistics concerning the improvements in the
various ramifications of the nation's existence. For
the present let the statement suffice that in no direction
has a retrograde movement been perceptible:
on the contrary, a continuous progress has been
evident in almost every matter from the curing of
beef to the making of scholars&mdash;two products that
are equally essential to the welfare of the land.</p>

<p>The early history of Uruguay needs but cursory
recapitulation, since its episodes form part and
parcel of the general discovery of the River Plate.
Juan Diaz de Solis, the famous explorer of the great
river, was the first leader in the Spanish service
to set foot on Uruguayan soil. The precise point
of his disembarkation is unknown, but it is certain
enough that the spot lay somewhere just to the north
of the island of Martin Garcia. His reception at
the hands of the hostile Charrúa Indians, who at
the time inhabited the district, was fatally inhospitable.
Solis and many more of the landing party of
fifty who accompanied him were slain by these natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
almost as soon as they had landed, and the disheartened
expedition returned to Spain.</p>

<p>It is supposed that Rodriguez Serrano was the first
to sail the waters of the Uruguay River proper.
In 1520, when anchored in the mouth of the River
Plate on his way to the South, Magellane is supposed
to have sent this subordinate of his some
distance up the Uruguay. There is much, however,
that is vague in the history of these particular waterways
at this time. A certain material reason obtained
for the mystery. The rivalry between the Spaniards
and Portuguese tended towards a concealment on
the part of each of discoveries that affected comparatively
unknown and debatable areas. Thus there
is no doubt that various Portuguese expeditions
sailed the Uruguay River at this period; but the
details of these are uncertain.</p>

<p>In 1527 Spain, fearing the possibilities of Portuguese
influence, turned her attention once more to
the great river system of the South. It was in
that year that Cabot founded the fort of San
Sebastian on the Uruguayan coast. This, at the
confluence of the San Salvador River with the
Uruguay, was the first Spanish settlement in the
country. Its existence was short-lived. Attacked by
the Charrúa Indians in 1529, the fort was destroyed
and many of its garrison slain.</p>

<p>After this little was heard of the Uruguayan coast
until, in 1552, Irala, the famous Governor of the
River Plate, ordered Captain Juan Romero to found
a settlement on that shore. Juan Romero set out
with an expedition of 120 men, and founded the
settlement of San Juan at the mouth of the river of
the same name. This attempt was likewise unsuccessful.
The Charrúas had to be reckoned with, and
two years later the place was abandoned on account
of their incessant attacks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1573 another noted <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">conquistador</i>, Zarate, on
the completion of his voyage from Europe, arrived
at the island of San Gabriel. He founded a settlement
on the neighbouring Uruguayan mainland, and
the Charrúas for once received him with comparative
hospitality. Nevertheless it was not long ere hostilities
broke out, by reason of the Spaniard's own
arrogance, it is said. In the end the Europeans were
completely defeated by the famous chief Zapicán,
losing over one hundred soldiers and various officers.
The Spaniards then retired to the island of San
Gabriel, leaving the aboriginal tribe in possession
of the new township, which they immediately
destroyed.</p>

<p>A short while after this Juan de Garay, afterwards
famed as the founder of the modern Buenos Aires,
arrived near the scene of the disaster. With a
diminutive force (it is said by some that his expedition
comprised no more than twelve cavalry and
twenty-two infantry) he attacked Zapicán's army of
a thousand men. The result was the rout of the
Indians, in the course of which Zapicán and many
other leading caciques perished. This action was
fought in the neighbourhood of ruined San Salvador,
and Zarate founded a new settlement on the ruins
of the old. Triumph, however, was short-lived, for
the Indians remained as fiercely persevering as
ever, and three years later their aggressive
tactics caused the establishment to be abandoned
once again.</p>

<p>In 1603 it is said that Hernando Arias de
Saavedra, the first colonial-born Governor of the
River Plate, led an expedition of five hundred men
against the Charrúas. Hernandarias, by which name
the Governor was popularly known, was a famous
warrior of whose prowess and feats of arms much
is told. For all that, according to report, the defeat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of the Spanish force was so complete that only
Hernandarias, thanks to his tremendous personal
strength, escaped from the field alive. It is probable,
however, that this version of the fight is, to say the
least of it, exaggerated.</p>

<p>The next move of Hernandarias in the direction
of the Banda Oriental was of a more pacific nature.
With a rare touch of wisdom and foresight he shipped
from Buenos Aires to Colonia across the river one
hundred head of cattle, and a like number of horses
and mares. These, sent adrift to roam at their own
sweet will in the new country, multiplied at least as
fast as had been anticipated. The animals in question
undoubtedly stand as the nucleus of the pastoral
riches of to-day. Thus Hernandarias sent out wealth
to the land that was closed to his men in order
that it should seed and multiply until the time came
for the European to take it over with the country
itself.</p>

<p>In this earlier era of River Plate history the march
of civilisation had been arrested at the first step in
Uruguay on each occasion on which it had been
undertaken. It was not until the beginning of the
seventeenth century that success attended the
endeavours of the Spaniards. In 1618 the first
missionaries entered Uruguay. The Franciscan
fathers Bernardo de Guzman, Villavicencio, and
Aldao landed in that year at the mouth of the Rio,
and converted to Christianity many members of the
more peaceably disposed tribes. In 1624 Bernardo
de Guzman founded the first Uruguayan Jesuit settlement,
Santo Domingo de Soriano, and a little later
the missions of Espinillo, Viboras, and Aldao were
established in the present provinces of Soriano and
Colonia. Larger and more important missions were
shortly afterwards founded in the north, and formed
a more or less integral portion of the great Jesuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
field in Paraguay. At one time there were no less
than thirty-seven of these stations existing within
the frontiers of the old Banda Oriental as they were
then defined. In consequence of the later Brazilian
encroachments, however, the sites of only seven of
these&mdash;San Francisco de Borga, San Nicolas, San
Juan Bautista, San Luis Gonzaga, San Miguel, San
Lorenzo, and Santa Angel&mdash;lie within the boundaries
of the present Republic.</p>

<p>While in the north of Uruguay the Indians, taught
by the missionaries, were now beginning to occupy
themselves with agriculture and grazing, in the south
the herds introduced by Hernandarias were multiplying
amazingly. These were responsible for the visits
of many who came over from Argentina to slay
the cattle and to collect their hides. They were
licensed by the Cabildo of Buenos Aires, who received
a third of the profits. In order to facilitate this
traffic in hides, these <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Faeneros</i>, as they were termed,
gradually established themselves upon the banks of
the Uruguay and its tributaries, and upon the ocean
coast. Thus the names of Cufré, Pavón, Toledo,
Pando, Solis, Maldonado, and many others have been
bequeathed to the soil by the merchant adventurers
who trafficked in those spots, since each named his
settlement after himself.</p>

<p>No little competition was afforded these Faeneros
by the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Changadores</i>, adventurers of a more reckless
order who made their incursions into the country
without licence and against the law. Corresponding
precisely to the buccaneers of the farther north, they
slew where opportunity offered, taking refuge in
Brazil when pursued, until their growing numbers
enabled them from time to time to offer armed resistance
to the officers of the Crown sent to chastise
them. Attracted by this commerce, pirates, whether
of Portuguese or other nationality, would occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
make descents, and would raid and harry the cattle
in their turn. The Indians, for their part, were
not slow in availing themselves of this new and convenient
source of livelihood, and, according to a
Uruguayan writer became "carnivorous from
necessity and equestrian from force of imitation."
In 1680 a more serious danger threatened the Banda
Oriental. At the beginning of that year a Portuguese
fleet came to anchor off the island of San Gabriel.
Eight hundred soldiers and a number of colonist
families were disembarked at Colonia del Sacramento
on the mainland, where they founded a township.
On learning of this invasion the Governor of Buenos
Aires, José de Garro, immediately demanded the
evacuation of the place. As a reply to this request,
Lobo, the Portuguese commander, triumphantly produced
a map on which Colonia was represented as
in Brazilian territory. A strenuous geographical discussion
ensued, at the conclusion of which Garro,
having failed to convince the intruders of the
inaccuracy of the chart by more subtle arguments,
resolved to expel the enemy by force.</p>

<p>With this end in view he obtained the loan of three
thousand Indians from the Jesuits, who were by this
time becoming accustomed to the lending of men
and arms for such patriotic purposes. With this
force, stiffened by the presence of three hundred
Spaniards, he captured the hostile settlement, taking
prisoners the Portuguese Governor and garrison.</p>

<p>It is related that the Spanish general had prepared
a striking <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">ruse de guerre</i> that was to serve in this
assault. Four thousand loose horses were to be
driven to the front of the charging forces, and upon
these animals the first devastation of the artillery
fire of the defenders was to expend itself. The
Indians, however, whose destined place was in the
vanguard, raised some powerful objections to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
scheme of attack. Considering with reason that a
backward rush of the wounded and terrified beasts&mdash;like
that of the elephants of a previous age&mdash;would
promise greater disaster to themselves than to the
enemy, they protested against the living bulwark with
its many possibilities. Thus the town was captured
without the aid of the horses, and the first of the
many combats that reddened the shore of Colonia
ended in favour of Spain.</p>

<p>This triumph was short-lived. In 1681 Carlos II.
of Spain in a weak moment signed a treaty by which
Colonia was given back to Portugal, to be held by her
until a definite decision could be arrived at concerning
the vexed question of ownership. In the meanwhile
it was arranged that the geographical arguments
should be settled by the pontifical authorities,
whose expert knowledge upon the point was doubtful.
The Portuguese, moreover, in order to obtain
an added salve to their dignity, stipulated that Garro
should be deprived of his post. This was complied
with; but the result did not in the least coincide
with the Portuguese expectations. Garro himself
must have smiled broadly when he learned that he
was deprived of his command at Buenos Aires in
order to take over the superior governorship of
Chile!</p>

<p>In 1702 a campaign was waged against the
Indians. The tactics of the majority of the tribes
had remained consistently aggressive, and their
predatory interest in the commerce of hides and
dried meat had developed to a pitch inconvenient
to the settlers. The war, although its scope did not
include the entire aboriginal population, was one of
extermination so far as it went, and at its conclusion
the sections of the Charrúas, Bohanes, and Yaros in
the neighbourhood of the River Yi had practically
ceased to exist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meanwhile Colonia, in the hands of the
Portuguese, had become the centre of contraband
operations by means of which merchandise was
smuggled into the sternly closed port of Buenos
Aires. As a point of vantage it served so admirably
for this purpose, and so greatly to the profit of both
the Portuguese and of the more unscrupulous
residents of Buenos Aires, that in 1705 Philip V.
of Spain ordered its recapture in earnest.</p>

<p>For this purpose two thousand Spaniards and four
thousand Jesuit Indians assembled. After a six
months' strenuous siege of the place the Portuguese
garrison fled in a fleet that had been sent to their
rescue, and Colonia passed back into the hands of
the Spaniards. But the vicissitudes of the spot were
not yet at an end. Oblivious of the past, Philip V.
by the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 ceded the town to
the Portuguese. Garcia Ros, the Governor of Buenos
Aires, was of sterner mould. Taking advantage of
a loosely worded clause in the treaty, he limited the
Portuguese ownership of the soil to the radius of a
cannon-shot from the plaza of the town. By this
means the inconvenience of the occupation was to
a certain extent neutralised.</p>

<p>About this time negro slaves were first introduced
from Africa into the provinces of the River Plate.
This measure had been originally urged by the
famous Father Bartolomé de las Casas with a view
of augmenting the local force of labour, and thus
of alleviating the condition of the aboriginal races
that in many parts were becoming exterminated on
account of the excess of toil imposed upon them.
This state of affairs, as a matter of fact, did not
obtain in the Banda Oriental, where Indian and
Spaniard stood entirely apart. Nevertheless an influx
of negroes occurred in the province, and&mdash;though
nothing can be said in favour of the morality of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
proceeding&mdash;there is no doubt that, once arrived, their
presence tended to benefit the industries of the land.</p>

<p>The period now was one of considerable unrest
throughout the Spanish main. For some while the
adventurers of other nations, seeking a share in the
great riches of the South American provinces, had
been knocking loudly at the gates that remained
closely barred to them. Privateering and raids upon
the coast had become more and more frequent, while
the Spanish galleons, in continuous dread of attack,
only put to sea for the purpose of long voyages in
imposing numbers and beneath weighty escort. The
River Plate, owing to the practical absence of the
mineral traffic from its frontier, suffered far fewer
depredations than fell to the lot of the gold and silver
bearing countries to the north.</p>

<p>Yet the homelier riches of the pastoral districts
were becoming known and appreciated to a certain
extent. In consequence of this the waters of the
River Plate from time to time had many unwelcome
visitors. Privateers of all nationalities, although their
enforced ignorance of the navigation forbade them
to penetrate for any distance up the waters of the
great streams themselves in the face of local opposition,
harassed the coast-line, and occasionally landed
in more or less formidable parties. One of the most
notable of these was a French adventurer of the
name of Moreau, whose buccaneering ideas were
considerably in advance of those of the majority
who were wont to harry these particular districts.
Moreau's plan of campaign, in fact, savoured rather
of regular warfare than of the more usual methods
of the rapid raidings and retreats. Thus in 1720 he
disembarked with a body of men and four cannon
at Maldonado, where he fortified himself, and began
to amass a great store of hides. Surprised by the
Spaniards, he was forced to take to his ships in haste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
with the loss of his guns and of his stock-in-trade.
A few months later the Frenchman returned, accompanied
this time by a force of over a hundred well-armed
men, and prepared to settle himself for an
extended stay in the country. Curiously enough, it
appears to have been the unfortunate Moreau's fate
to reverse the fighting rôles of the buccaneer and
local resident, since, instead of surprising others, it
was he who was caught unawares on either occasion.
The termination of his second visit was more fatal
than that of his first. Attacked when in an unprepared
condition by the Spaniards, the defeat of the
buccaneer force was complete. Moreau himself was
slain, together with the greater part of his company,
while the remainder were taken prisoners.</p>

<p>Freed from this source of danger, the inhabitants
of the Banda Oriental were not long left without
anxiety on another head. The Portuguese had never
ceased to covet the rich land that might be made to
serve as such a valuable and temperate pendant to
their torrid northern areas. The River Plate stood
to them in the light of a Rhine, and at the end of
1723 they awoke once more into aggressive activity.
An expedition then left Rio de Janeiro consisting
of four ships with three hundred soldiers. The force
sailed to the point where the town of Montevideo now
stands, at that time a lonely spot whose commercial
and strategic importance was then for the first time
discovered. Here the expedition landed, and in a
short while its leaders had negotiated with the natives
whom they found in the district, had supplied them
with arms, and had founded a settlement. On learning
of this aggression the Buenos Aires authorities
determined to resist the attempt in earnest. Gavala,
the Spanish Governor, collected a powerful fleet, and
sailed in haste to the spot. The Portuguese, ascertaining
the strength of the attacking force, abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
their new settlement, and made off to the north without
awaiting its arrival. Gavala then took possession
of Montevideo in turn, and took measures in order
to prevent a repetition of the incident. To this end
he constructed a powerful battery on the spot,
and supplied the fort with a garrison of a hundred
Spanish troops, and with a thousand native
auxiliaries.</p>

<p>On the 24th of December, 1726, was founded the
city proper of Montevideo. Its inception was
sufficiently modest. Indeed, the spot commenced its
urban existence on a human diet of seven families
translated from Buenos Aires for the purpose. A
little later twenty families were brought from the
Canary Islands to add to the humble population.
It is not a little curious to read how, even in those
early days, the spirit of colonial enterprise was
already manifest in the way that is now considered
most up-to-date. Intending immigrants to Montevideo
were each offered free transport from Buenos
Aires, plots in the city and holdings in the Campo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
two hundred head of cattle, one hundred sheep, and
free cartage of building material. They were
offered, beyond, tools, agricultural implements, and
a remission of taxes for a certain period. The whole
savours strongly of a modern immigration department.
In any case, the inducements offered were
considerable.</p>

<p>Two years after its foundation Montevideo
received an important reinforcement of citizens,
when thirty families from the Canary Islands and
from Galicia were introduced into the place. Thus
the small town was already beginning to make its
mark upon the surrounding country, and at the end
of 1728 it could count over two hundred inhabitants,
four hundred troops, and a thousand Indians
employed principally in the works of fortification.
A couple of years later it was deemed worthy of a
corporation.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in this very year the growing settlement
all but came to a bloody and untimely end.
A rising of the Charrúa Indians in the immediate
neighbourhood of Montevideo resisted all the efforts
made to subdue it. Over one hundred Spaniards
were slain and the royal forces put to rout. The
natives, drunk with success, were on the eve of
entering Montevideo and of slaughtering the
inhabitants, when a Jesuit missionary, Padre Herán,
intervened, and prevailed on the Indians to desist
from their purpose.</p>

<p>Scarcely had this danger passed when another, and
remoter, came into being to take its place. The
restless Portuguese having given peace to the Banda
Oriental for ten years, doubtless considered the period
unduly prolonged, and thus invaded the Rio Grande
on the northern frontier. Lavala's successor, Don
Miguel de Salcedo, a ruler as impotent as the first
had been strong, contented himself with besieging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Colonia as a counter-stroke, while the Portuguese
forces were left free to complete the conquest of
Rio Grande. This they continued to hold, despite
the terms of an armistice arranged in 1737 between
Spain and Portugal.</p>

<p>For ten years after this no historical event of
importance occurred to disturb the progress of
Uruguay. In 1747 a rising of the Indians was
utterly crushed at Queguay, and two years later
Montevideo, now acknowledged as a town of
importance, was accorded a Governor of its own.
Don José Joaquin de Viana was the first appointed
to the post. His opinion of its urgency is evident
from the fact that he only took office in 1751.</p>

<p>By the treaty of 1750 King Ferdinand VI. of
Spain ceded to Portugal the northern stretches comprising
the Jesuit Missions of Uruguay and the
present province of Rio Grande in exchange for
Colonia. As a stroke of commercial diplomacy the
bargain was undoubtedly a failure, since by its means
Spain not only lost for ever two flourishing
provinces, but, in addition, the Jesuits and their
Indians were obliged to forsake the field of their
labours, and to migrate in search of fresh country.</p>

<p>This, however, was not the case with all alike.
A large number of the Indians, deeply attached to
the neighbourhoods wherein lay their homes, refused
to follow the missionaries, and in the end resisted the
unwelcome decree. Pitted against the combined
forces of Buenos Aires, Uruguay, and Brazil, their
cause had not a momentary chance of success. After
suffering various defeats, they were finally routed
and almost exterminated at Caaibate in 1756, when
the native loss amounted to 154 prisoners and 1,200
dead, at the very moderate Spanish cost of 4 dead
and 41 wounded. The character of the action is
sufficiently evident from the butcher's bill. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
certain number of the surviving Indians were taken
to Maldonado, and, settling there, formed the nucleus
of the present town.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Colonia, whose inhabitants by
this time must have been rendered giddy by the continuous
substitution of bunting, had again passed
into the possession of the Portuguese. The recurrence
of war between these and the Spaniards gave
Pedro de Ceballos, an able and energetic Governor
of Buenos Aires, an opportunity to act. In 1762
he surprised Colonia, captured it, and was in the
act of invading the ceded territory of Rio Grande
when the Treaty of Paris came inopportunely into
being to stay him in his path of conquest, and to
give back Colonia, that bone of contention, to the
Portuguese once more.</p>

<p>This occurred in 1763, and Ceballos was powerless
to struggle further against a fate that caused
victory to be followed by the loss of provinces.
Nevertheless, he took various measures towards the
preservation of the remaining territory. One of
the most important of these was concerned with the
numerous Portuguese families that were settled along
the eastern frontier of the country. Having reason
to believe that these were hatching further warlike
schemes in conjunction with the authorities across the
border, Ceballos caused them to be taken south, and
to be collected together in a small settlement in the
neighbourhood of Maldonado, where they could
remain under the watchful eye of the Uruguayan
officials.</p>

<p>In 1767 the expulsion of the Jesuits from South
America by King Carlos III. of Spain proved of no
little moment to the Banda Oriental, since many
of the Indians, wandering shepherdless and at a loss,
came southwards, and became part and parcel of
Uruguay. It was by means of twelve of these Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
families that the city of Paysandú, amongst several
others, was founded, while the fields of Montevideo
and Maldonado derived many new cultivators from
this source.</p>

<p>It was but a very few years later that the trouble
with the Portuguese broke out once again. Indeed,
it would seem that indulgence in border feud had
now become an ineradicable habit on the part of
both sides. By the year 1774 the inhabitants of
Brazil had once again passed over the north-western
frontier, and had spread themselves over the country
in such numbers as to render their presence a menace
to Uruguay. In order to remedy the situation, Vertiz,
the Governor of Buenos Aires, crossed from Buenos
Aires to Montevideo, from which city he sallied out
northwards with an army of four thousand men.
Meeting with the Portuguese forces in the neighbourhood
of the Santa Tecla range, he routed them
and pursued them as far as the River Yacuy,
depriving them of the lands they had usurped.</p>

<p>On the return of Vertiz to Buenos Aires, Portuguese
aggression burst forth once again. Advancing
from the east this time, they were repulsed in an
attack on the town of San Pedro; but in 1776,
returning with an army of two thousand men, they
captured the place and possessed themselves of the
district. The inevitable counter-stroke on the part
of the Spaniards was to follow. Indeed, the scale
of the struggle waxed steadily with the growth of the
respective countries. Brazil was already the seat of
a viceroyalty, and immediately after this last invasion
the provinces of the River Plate were raised to the
same status. Ceballos, then on a visit to Spain,
was created first Viceroy, and was dispatched from
Cadiz with a powerful fleet and with over nine
thousand troops to avenge the incursion.</p>

</div>

<p>With such forces as these at his disposal the task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of Ceballos was an easy one. The Island of Santa
Catalina was captured without a blow, and that bone
of contention, Colonia, surrendered perforce after
a few days of siege. Above its walls for the fifth
time the flag of Spain was hoisted afresh. On this
occasion the ill-omened place was destined to pay
for the memories of the past, and its walls suffered
in place of the garrison. In order to remove temptation
from the minds of the northern enemy, Ceballos
razed the elaborate fortifications to the ground and
destroyed the more pretentious houses, amongst these
being some of the best architectural specimens of the
River Plate.</p>

<p>Having effected this, Ceballos was passing northwards
with the intention of bringing back the Rio
Grande Province once more within the fold of Buenos
Aires, when his march was stopped by the news of
another of those treaties between the mother-countries
that seemed to materialise with unfailing
regularity at moments so ill-timed for the interests
of the Spanish colonies. By the terms of this Spain
was left with the mines of Colonia, while the Island
of Santa Catalina and the greater part of Rio Grande
were ceded definitely to Portugal.</p>

<p>After this ensued an exceptionally lengthy era of
peace, which was marked by the immigration of many
families from Galicia and from the Canary Islands,
and by the foundation of numerous towns, amongst
these latter Canelones, Piedras, Rosario, Mercedes,
Pando, Santa Lucia, San José, and Minas. As to
the capital itself, by the year 1788 Montevideo had
become a fairly important place, and could count a
population of 6,695 Spaniards, 1,386 negro slaves,
562 liberated negroes, and 715 half-castes and
Indians. A few years later the population was much
augmented by the introduction of important numbers
of negro slaves, a traffic that continued intermittently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
until 1825, when its continuance was prohibited by
law.</p>

<p>At the end of the century an industry was initiated
that might have led to important commercial results
but for the action of the Spanish home authorities.
The waters off the coast of Maldonado had long been
famed as a whaling-ground, and at this period permission
was given to the Englishmen engaged in the
traffic to found establishments both at this place
and at Punta de la Ballena. The result was a rapid
but fleeting prosperity at both these points, since
after a while the attitude of the Court of Spain
changed. Fearful of the influence of the English
upon the Uruguayans, the authorities offered to the
new colonists the option of becoming Roman
Catholics and of swearing allegiance to the King of
Spain, or of abandoning the settlement. The latter
alternative was chosen by the whalers, and Maldonado
and Punta de la Ballena, in consequence,
sank back into the lethargy of industrial torpor. The
instance is only one of the many in which the mother-country
satisfied its conscience at the expense of its
colony.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A corps of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Blandengues</i>, or Lancers, was formed
in 1797, whose duties, beyond their military performances,
were varied to a degree. Thus, in
addition to the occasional brushes with the Indians
that fell to their lot, they were employed as excise
officials against the smugglers, as escorts of high
officials, as ordinary police, and as official
messengers. The corps was composed of picked
men, and in its ranks served José Gervasio Artigas
and José Rondeau, both bearers of names that were
destined to become famous in Uruguayan history.</p>

<p>This body of cavalry was destined to be employed
on active service very soon after its formation. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
1801 the Portuguese became active once more, and
the first year of the new century was marked by
their occupation of land in the north-west of the
Banda Oriental. After various actions, Rondeau,
with a force of Blandengues and dragoons, defeated
the invaders and won back the greater part of the
lost territory.</p>

<p>In 1806 occurred the first of the British invasions
which, although materially fruitless in the end so far
as our own country was concerned, were destined
to influence the minds of the colonials and the future
of the River Plate Provinces to a greater extent
than is generally realised. The circumstances of
the invasion that won to the British Crown for a
very short while not only Montevideo, Maldonado,
Colonia, and numerous lesser Uruguayan towns, but
Buenos Aires in addition, afford bitter reading.
Thanks to the colossal incapacity&mdash;to give his conduct
no harder name&mdash;of the British Commander-in-Chief,
General Whitlocke, the last troops of the British
army of occupation had sailed away northwards from
Montevideo by the beginning of September, 1807.</p>

<p>Although the matter ended for the British with
the departure of the troops from the River Plate,
the aftermath of the event took very definite shape
in the Spanish colonies themselves. Not only had the
inhabitants of the provinces learned their own power,
but&mdash;more especially in the case of Montevideo&mdash;the
seeds of commercial liberty had been sown
amongst the local merchants and traders by the
English men of business who had descended upon
the place beneath the protection of the army. That
the final leave-taking between the English and the
Uruguayans should have been accompanied by actual
cordiality and regrets is surely an astonishing circumstance
that affords great credit to both sides.
There can be no doubt, however, that this mutual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
esteem was in the first place fostered by an appreciation
on the part of the residents of British laws
and methods of trading.</p>

<p>Whether the germs thus left behind would have
fructified so rapidly but for the chaotic condition
of the mother-country is doubtful. As it was, scarcely
had the smoke of these actions cleared away when it
became necessary for the patriots of the River Plate
Province to look once again to their primings in
view of still more vital occurrences.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I do not propose to tell here the full story of the
rebellion of the River Plate Provinces and of the
revolution that ended in the complete overthrow of
Spanish power in South America, since I have already
roughly sketched these events elsewhere. So far as
the main events are concerned, the transition from
the colonial stage to the condition of independence
was slower in the Banda Oriental than was the
process upon the eastern bank of the great river.
In Julio of 1810, when the Junta of Buenos Aires
had already established itself to cast off the yoke of
Spain, Montevideo still remained faithful to the
mother-country, and rejected the advances of the
Argentines.</p>

<p>Thus at the beginning of 1811 Montevideo found
itself, if only for a short while, the seat of the viceroyalty
of the La Plata Provinces, and from that
point of vantage Elio, the Viceroy, declared war upon
Buenos Aires. Almost immediately, however, the
spirit of independence became manifest in Uruguay
itself, and it is at this juncture that occurs the name
that has perhaps stamped itself most deeply of all
upon the history of the Banda Oriental.</p>

<p>The personality of Artigas, the central figure of the
Uruguayan revolutionary era, is fully described in a
later chapter. It is necessary here, therefore, merely
to give the record of historical occurrences, without
laying stress on the individuality of the Oriental
leader, a matter that is not easy of accomplishment,
since the figure of Artigas seems to have dominated
the field of action in whatever direction it lay.</p>

<p>Shortly after the outbreak of the revolution
Artigas, who at the time was in the Spanish service,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
joined the patriot ranks after a violent quarrel with
his brigadier. The Oriental fled across the river
to Buenos Aires. Here he received a warm welcome,
and was supplied with armed men and financial aid
in order to foment the movement in his native
country. Beyond this he received the official rank
of lieutenant-colonel in the Army of Independence.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the first stirrings of the war that
was to come had already shaken Uruguay. With its
capital, Montevideo, now the seat of the viceroyalty,
the small province had remained more or less
quiescent, lying, as it were, directly beneath the
eye of Imperial Spain itself. But the awakening,
when it occurred, was followed by a strenuous outbreak
of activity. The first important rising took
place at Paysandú, on the banks of the Uruguay
River. This was crushed by the aid of the Spanish
war vessels that lay in the stream. But the
inhabitants, not in the least discouraged by this first
check, rose again in greater numbers than before.
A body of one hundred gauchos, ill-armed as it was,
captured the town of Mercedes, and then, with
augmented forces, marched on Soriano, which
surrendered to them.</p>

<p>This success was the signal for a general rising
throughout the country. At the beginning of 1811
the Spanish garrison found themselves in the midst
of a definitely hostile population. From one frontier
to another bodies of men were gathering together,
forging weapons from agricultural tools, and arming
themselves as best they could in order that they
might take their share in the struggle for liberation
that was already in active being. In March the
towns of Maldonado, San Carlos, and Minas rose,
and the country just to the east of Montevideo itself
threw off the Spanish authority and came into
possession of the insurrectionist companies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 11th of April, 1811, Artigas returned to
Uruguay in command of 150 men of the regiment
of Patricios, and disembarked in the neighbourhood
of that hub of all strife, Colonia. Here he was
welcomed by a great number of armed countryfolk,
who acclaimed him as chief of the Orientales. The
movement now fairly under way, he established his
headquarters at Mercedes. In the meanwhile the
germ of future combinations had already been
created by the appointment on the part of
the Buenos Aires patriots of Rondeau as commander
of the Uruguayans. Belgrano, first named
for the post, had, disgraced, been deprived of it
since his defeat by the Paraguayans.</p>

<p>Artigas's first collision with the royal forces
occurred at Paso del Rey, the Spanish army being
completely defeated. Reinforced by a second
victorious column, under Benavidez, the Uruguayans
followed up the retreating regulars, and forced them
to surrender.</p>

<p>Artigas, the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Jefe de los Orientales</i>, had now at
his disposal a force of over a thousand men.
Meeting at Las Piedras with a royalist army of
1,230 men, the valour of the new levies was soon
put to the test. Although the Spaniards possessed
the advantage of artillery, they were in the end,
after a desperate and prolonged fight that endured
for half a dozen hours, defeated and forced to
surrender.</p>

<p>The doings of the patriotic force came as a blow
to the Spanish authorities at Montevideo. Urged
by the first tremblings of the viceregal throne beneath
him, Elio cast about him for an inducement to turn
Artigas from his victorious course. To this end he
sent messengers offering the chieftain a heavy
monetary bribe to desert the patriot cause, and to
take service again in the royalist cause. Whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
any offering of any kind would have tempted Artigas
is doubtful. But in any case the tender was eloquent
of Elio's want of acquaintance with the Gaucho
temperament, to which the possession of mere cash
constitutes a matter of utter indifference. As it
was, Artigas treated the offer with angry contempt.</p>

<p>The hour of the patriot leader's triumph was not
without its sting. The battle of Las Piedras had
won him the rank of colonel in the revolutionary
forces, it is true; but Belgrano, after Suipacha,
had risen to that of a general. And, although both
the Buenos Aires Government and the official
<cite>Gazette</cite>, using the soft soap of courtesy titles,
referred continuously to Artigas by the honorary
term of "General," the bitterness remained to give
rise to future strife.</p>

<p>Three days after his victory Artigas marched to
Montevideo, and laid siege to the headquarters itself
of the Spanish régime. As a preliminary to the
operation an exchange of prisoners, wounded and
whole, was effected. Artigas then formally demanded
the surrender of the garrison; Elio responded by
various sorties, all of which were repulsed. The
beginning of the siege was marked by a dramatic
episode. Suspecting the revolutionary sympathies of
some Franciscan monks domiciled in Montevideo,
Elio decided to expel these from the city. The
Franciscans were led through the streets with the
utmost silence at the dead of night. Arrived at
the gates, the officer in charge of the escort pointed
with his sword at some sparks of light that
twinkled faintly in the distance. "Go you with
the butchers!" he commanded, and the priests
passed out silently into the darkness to join the
forces of Artigas. Their influence was doubtless
exhilarating to the patriot cause, but there is no
evidence to show that it was employed in the cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of mercy. A few days later forty Uruguayan families
suffered a similar fate.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Benavidez had laid siege to
Colonia, the garrison of which, after a month's
resistance, escaped by river to Montevideo. It was
upon this latter place that the fortune of the Spanish
dominion now hung. The scale of warfare was
increasing in proportion to the importance of the
issue. Shortly after the arrival of the reinforcements
supplied by the Royalist fugitives from Colonia,
Rondeau, in command of the Argentine troops,
arrived to take charge of the attacking force, that
now amounted to four thousand men. Artigas, now
one amongst many, dropped in rank from commander
to leader of horse.</p>

<p>Rondeau had contrived to drag two heavy guns
to the spot, and with these he opened fire upon
Montevideo. Galled by a continuous bombardment,
Elio took a more desperate step than was justified
even by his situation. Carlota, the Queen of Portugal
and the sister of Ferdinand VII. of Spain, had been
established in Rio de Janeiro since the invasion of
the peninsula by the Napoleonic armies. To her
the Viceroy, seeing the last foothold of power
slipping from beneath him, sent an urgent message
for assistance.</p>

<p>Ere the response to this appeal became evident
the condition of the beleagured town had changed.
Discouraged by the serious defeat at Huaqui of the
army of Peru, the revolutionary leaders of Buenos
Aires were already contemplating a retirement from
before Montevideo, when the blow engineered by
Elio took effect. A swarm of Portuguese, under
command of General Diego de Souza, entered the
Banda Oriental from the north with the purpose
of overrunning the country. The Buenos Aires
Government, appalled by the new turn that affairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
had taken, made the utmost haste to conclude an
armistice with Elio. By the terms of the treaty
the patriot forces were to retire from Montevideo,
and Spanish authority was to be recognised throughout
Uruguay in exchange for the return of Souza's
forces to Brazil. Thus Elio's unscrupulous move
had succeeded for the time being, and the first siege
of Montevideo came to an end. A month after its
conclusion Elio retired to Spain. The command he
had left was now no longer worthy of the highest
rank, and the departed Viceroy was succeeded by
Vigodet in the minor capacity of Captain-General.</p>

<p>Artigas had from the first bitterly opposed this
treaty, by the terms of which the Orientales were
to be left at the mercy of the Royalists. That
he had right upon his side from his own point of
view is undeniable, although it is difficult to see
by what other means the Buenos Aires Government,
caught between the Spaniards and the Brazilians,
could have extricated themselves from their dilemma.
The treaty once concluded, however, Artigas initiated
a move that in itself proved the greatness of the
man.</p>

<p>A general assembly of the patriotic Oriental
families was sounded. Obedient to the call, they
mustered in numbers that amounted to over thirteen
thousand men, women, and children. Then followed
the exodus, ordained by the stress of events, of which
Artigas was the human instrument. Escorted by
three thousand soldiers, the march of the families
began. Carts filled with women and children, herds
of cattle, troops of horses, companies of pack-mules,
to say nothing of the riders themselves&mdash;the tragic
procession toiled its long length northwards through
the summer dust clouds struck up by the hoofs and
feet from the crude earth roads. Mingled with the
slowly advancing ranks, and lending still greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
variety to the whole, went four hundred faithful
Charrúa Indians, armed with bolas and spears.</p>

<p>Over the rolling hills of Uruguay struggled the
human thread of emigrants. Death waited on the
column in the shape of heat and hardship. But,
though many children and many aged folk fell by
the way, the great majority won through in safety
to Salto, on the banks of the Uruguay; crossed the
great river in boats, and took up their abode on
the Argentine shore, awaiting with anxiety the hour
that might permit their return to their native land.</p>

<p>In the meantime matters were passing from bad
to worse in Uruguay. Once within its frontiers,
the temptations of the promised land overcame any
scruple on the part of the Portuguese concerning
a too rigid adherence to the terms of the treaty.
Under the convenient pretext of pacifying an already
deserted country, Souza's army overran the smiling
Campo, capturing towns and plundering where they
might. The Spanish royalists, for their part, remained
passive, and the sole opposition with which
the Portuguese armies had to count was that rendered
by the forces of Artigas, sent by him across the river.
But, although they won a victory or two, the slender
patriot bands were unable to stem the tide of invasion
to any appreciable degree.</p>

<p>It is a little curious to remark what an endless
wealth of complications appear to have attended every
political move at this period. In this particular
instance the introduction of a new element was productive
of unexpected results. Thus, when the
Buenos Aires Government, realising the gravity of
the situation, proposed to send reinforcements to the
assistance of Artigas, the move was checked by Elio,
the Spanish commander, who, forgetful of the ties
of blood, threatened to join cause with the Portuguese
in the event of any such intervention. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
an appropriate climax to the chaotic situation, the
Buenos Aires powers turned to Paraguay for assistance.
The latter, inclined to assent, began negotiation
with Artigas direct, and, since the Argentine
Government resented this slight upon its authority,
and the negotiations themselves failed to fructify,
the only outcome of importance was an increase in
the mutual jealousies that already existed between
Artigas and the Argentines.</p>

<p>Shortly after this, however, the tables were turned
upon the Spaniards. An able stroke of diplomacy
on the part of the famous Argentine, Belgrano, supported
by British influence, resulted in a treaty with
the Portuguese. Thus the Royalists, hoist by a
second edition of their own petard, lay without allies
at the mercy of the patriot forces.</p>

<p>Preparations for a fresh siege of Montevideo were
at once begun. Don Manuel Sarratea, appointed
Commander-in-Chief of the Argentine Army,
marched to the Entre Rios shore to join his
columns with those of Artigas. The inevitable
jealousies between the Argentine and Oriental leaders
came to a head almost immediately. Apart from
a deep personal antagonism that separated the pair,
a yet more potent reason made the rupture inevitable.
Sarratea, representing the triumvirate of
Buenos Aires, was determined to deal with Uruguay
as a province of the new Republic of Argentina.
Artigas, on the other hand, although willing to
acknowledge the authority at Buenos Aires from a
federal point of view, insisted upon the independence
of the State.</p>

<p>It was in these circumstances that Sarratea
descended upon Artigas's mixed camp of soldiers and
Uruguayan emigrant families upon the banks of the
Uruguay. The results of the meeting were soon
evident. Artigas, complaining bitterly that Sarratea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
had seduced from his allegiance not only his troops
but the civilian elements of the settlement, resigned
his colonelcy, and separated his division from the
Argentine forces. The troops now remaining to him
numbered rather less than a thousand men, under
the command of Otorgués, Rivera, and Manuel
Artigas.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Sarratea, anxious that the credit
for the capture of Montevideo should fall to his lot,
had dispatched a force under Rondeau to lay siege
once again to the town of contention that represented
the headquarters of the Royalists. Arriving
at the spot, he found that his task had already
been forestalled to a certain extent by an independent
Oriental, José Eugenio Culta. The latter <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caudillo</i>,
spurred onwards by the numerous examples of reckless
initiative offered by the period, had collected
a band of three hundred Gauchos. With these
kindred spirits he was busily occupied in harassing
the garrison to no little purpose.</p>

<p>With the arrival of Rondeau, in October of 1812,
the siege of the devoted city began on an imposing
scale, the army employed for the purpose soon
amounting to two thousand men. Destined to drag
out its length for almost two years, the first few
months of the siege were marked by two events of
importance. Vigodet, having received reinforcements
from Spain, made a vigorous sally on the last day
of the year. At early dawn sixteen hundred men
burst out from the gates of the city, surprising and
routing the besieging forces as they went, until they
won the summit of the Cerrito hill itself, the headquarters
of the American forces. With the yellow
and red of Spain flaunting from this the Royalists
forgot all but their success, and expended their
energies in a jubilation that cost them dear. For
Rondeau, gathering together his fugitive troops with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
an amazing rapidity, fell like a thunderbolt upon
the cheering crowd, whose joyful clamour turned to
groans and death gasps as the stricken mass went
reeling back into the city.</p>

<p>An event of still greater importance occurred
during the first month of the following year.
Sarratea himself then journeyed to the camp before
Montevideo. But he had company behind that he
could not have failed to regard with considerable
unease. Notwithstanding his late check, Artigas still
remained a power to be reckoned with. Indeed,
his vitality had risen to the occasion; he had flung
out his summons far and wide, and his power was
now infinitely greater than before. Thus, when
Sarratea set out for Montevideo, Artigas followed
grimly in his wake, having now no mean instrument
by means of which to assert his rights&mdash;an army
of five thousand men.</p>

<p>Arriving on the heels of his enemy at the point
of hostilities, Artigas was not slow to act. Taking
full measure of his advantage, he sent peremptorily
to Rondeau, demanding the immediate dismissal of
Sarratea from his office of Commander-in-Chief.
The order thus given to a subordinate to deal with
his superior was quite in accordance with the spirit
of the times.</p>

<p>As Rondeau, however, did not immediately comply,
Artigas took a very simple measure by which
to prove that he did not intend to ask in vain.
His Gauchos dashed full gallop into Sarratea's camp,
and drove off with them all the horses that they
found within the establishment. Seeing that a
Gaucho army, unhorsed, is as a collection of fish
on dry land, the matter was definitely settled by
the act. Sarratea retired with the best grace he
could muster to Buenos Aires, Rondeau remained
in command, and the Oriental and Argentine leaders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
sat down to continue the investment of Montevideo,
one jealous eye of each upon his fellow-chief, the
other fixed more casually upon the beleaguered
town.</p>

<p>During the comparative lull in active hostilities
that followed Artigas busied himself in the affairs
of the State that he was determined to see fully
created. To this end he convened a national Congress
of Uruguayans, of which he was, as a matter
of course, elected President, in addition to being
created Military Governor of the country. One of
the first acts of the new Congress was to advertise
its existence by the mission of deputies to the Junta
at Buenos Aires. But, the Junta refusing to recognise
either an independent Uruguay or its agents,
the deputies returned home to spread the tale of
the rebuff, and to increase the bitterness that already
lay so deep between the Buenos Aires authorities
and Artigas.</p>

<p>In January, 1814, the long series of incessant disputes
was brought abruptly to a head by Artigas.
In the dead of night he struck his hide tents, mounted
his men, and his entire force rode away over the
hills, leaving Rondeau and his army to continue the
siege of Montevideo as best they might. The Buenos
Aires authorities, furious at the defection, placed a
price upon Artigas's head; and the Gaucho leader,
equally incensed at this personal ultimatum, retaliated
by declaring open war upon the Junta.
Storming against the Buenos Airens, this born leader
of men took his body&mdash;valued by his enemies at
six thousand pesos, alive or dead&mdash;along the coast
of the great river. So successful were his denunciations
and the missions of his ambassadors that not
only the littoral provinces of Entre Rios, Corrientes,
and Santa Fé came spontaneously to his standard,
but the comparatively remote province of Córdoba,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
following the example of the rest, proffered its
allegiance.</p>

<p>It was not long ere the news of the rupture
reached the ears of Vigodet in Montevideo. Thinking
to derive profit from the occasion, he made a
final appeal to throw in his lot with the royal forces.
The Gaucho leader in his refusal is stated to have
said that "with the Porteños [Buenos Airens] there
was always time for reconciliation; with the
Spaniards, never!" That the time for the former
consummation was not yet ripe was evidenced by
the almost immediate outbreak of active hostilities
between the rival South American parties.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Montevideo was giving out the
last gasp of its imperial existence. The Spanish
fleet that had assisted in its defence had been
destroyed by Admiral Brown, the famous Irishman
in Argentine service. Hunger and the lack of
general necessaries both of livelihood and of war
completed the work of arms. On the 20th June,
1814, Montevideo, after suffering intense privations,
capitulated, and with its fall passed for ever the
last vestige of Spanish power from the provinces
of the River Plate.</p>

<p>The defeated eagle was fluttering slowly homeward
with broken wing. But its departure did not leave
the battlefield empty. It was the turn now of the
victorious hawks to rend each other. Alvear had
arrived from Buenos Aires, and was now in charge
of the newly won city. Scarcely had he begun his
work of organisation, however, when Otorgues,
Artigas's chief lieutenant, appeared at Las Piedras
in the neighbourhood of the capital, and in the name
of his leader demanded that the place should be
handed over to the Uruguayans. Alvear's answer
was unexpected and to the point. Marching his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
army through the darkness, he fell upon Otorgues's
forces in the middle of the night, shattering them
completely.</p>

<p>Thus the Buenos Aires authorities remained for
the time being masters of the city. As for their
sway, the Montevideans broke out into bitter complaints
that the Spanish dominion had been liberal
and lenient by comparison. However this may have
been, it is certain that those families noted for their
allegiance to Artigas were subjected to severe
penalties and restrictions.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the situation of the advocates of centralisation
had now become critical. By a curious
irony of fate the position of the Junta was exactly
identical with that formerly held by the Spaniards.
Montevideo lay in its power; but the remainder of
the Banda Oriental as well as the Argentine provinces
of Entre Rios, Correntes, and Santa Fé were completely
subject to Artigas. Alive to the growing
power of the Protector, the Buenos Aires Government
opened negotiations for a treaty, flinging out
in the first place an olive-branch in the shape of a
degree not only relieving the head of the Gaucho
leader of the dollars set upon it, but in addition
proclaiming him to the world as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">buen servidor de
la patria</i>&mdash;"a worthy servant of the country." A
meeting at Montevideo resulted in the evacuation of
Montevideo on the part of nearly the entire Buenos
Aires garrison. These departed by river; but,
instead of returning to Buenos Aires, the troops
landed at Colonia, marched inland to Minas, fell
upon Otorgues, whose camp lay in that district, and
completely routed the force of the unsuspecting
lieutenant.</p>

<p>This achieved, the victorious army set out in search
of Rivera, another of Artigas's commanders, who had
recently surprised and destroyed a Buenos Aires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
column. In this latter leader, however, Dorrego, the
Junta general, met with more than his match, and,
suffering many casualties, was forced to retire to
Colonia. Sallying out from here with reinforcements
a little later, he was utterly defeated, and fled in haste
to Corrientes, accompanied by some score of men
who formed the sole remnant of his entire army.</p>

<p>Just as the fall of Montevideo crowned the doom
of the Spanish power, so this final disaster marked
the end of the occupation of the town by the Buenos
Aires Government. A little more than a month after
the event the troops of the garrison sailed across to
Buenos Aires. The following day Fernando Otorgues
entered the place at the head of his troops. The
advent of the new Military Governor was hailed with
enthusiasm by the inhabitants. The unfurling of
Artigas's blue and white standard with its red bar
was answered by illuminations and fireworks by the
citizens.</p>

<p>For the first time in its history the capital of
Uruguay lay beneath the command of a Uruguayan.
By one of the first acts of the new régime a national
coat of arms was instituted, and a flaming proclamation
promised nothing short of the millennium. All
this would have been very well had it not been
necessary for this new benignity to be put immediately
to the test. It then became evident to the
depressed Montevideans that with each change of
rulers their load of evils had increased. With his
talents essentially confined to the field of battle, there
was probably no man in Uruguay who possessed less
of the lamb in his disposition than Otorgues. The
temperaments of his subordinates, reckless at the
best of times, had been further excited by merciless
warfare. Thus the inhabitants, at the mercy of the
utterly licentious Gaucho soldiers, continued to groan
for relief in vain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Artigas himself had not approached the city.
From points of vantage along the great river system
he had ceaselessly harassed the forces of the Junta,
until Alvear, its director, goaded to exasperation,
collected into an army every soldier that he could
spare, and, determined to put all to the hazard, sent
the imposing expedition against the Gaucho leader.
The adventure involved complete disaster to the
director. Ere it had passed the frontiers of Buenos
Aires Province, the army, encouraged by Artigas,
revolted, and its chief, Colonel Alvarez Thomas,
returned to Buenos Aires to depose Alvear, with
whose office he invested himself.</p>

<p>The power of the famous Oriental chief had now
reached its zenith. The new director, Alvarez
Thomas, acutely conscious of the Protector's power,
thought of nothing beyond conciliation. Among the
measures employed was one that redounded very little
to his credit. Not satisfied with the public burning
of the various proclamations hostile to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Caudillo</i>,
he bethought himself of a stake that should win for
ever the regard of Artigas. To this end he arrested
the seven chief friends of Alvear, and sent them as
a combined sacrifice and peace-offering to Artigas's
encampment. As a specimen of grim and sycophantic
courtesy the callousness of the offering of seven
bodies can scarcely have been exceeded in the world's
history. But Artigas, contrary to the Director's
expectation, failed to make the intended use of the
gifts. Indeed, he treated them with no little consideration,
and sent them back whence they came,
bidding them tell Thomas that the General Artigas
was no executioner.</p>

<p>The next move was of the legitimately political
order. The voluntary acknowledgment of the independence
of Uruguay was offered in exchange for
the abandonment of the protectorate over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
provinces of Entre Rios, Santa Fé, Córdoba, and
Corrientes. This was also refused by Artigas, who
maintained that the provinces of the River Plate
should, though self-governing, be indissolubly linked.</p>

<p>During all this time Artigas remained at his
encampment at Hervidero on the banks of the
Uruguay River. From thence by a system of
organisation that, though crude, was marvellously
effective, he manipulated the affairs of the extensive
region under his command, jealously watching
the moves of doubtful friends and open enemies,
and keeping his armed bands of remorseless Gauchos
ceaselessly on the alert.</p>

<p>This continual state of minor warfare, however,
did not altogether exclude the attention to civil
matters. In addition to some tentative measures of
administration in Córdoba and the Argentine littoral
provinces, Uruguay was partitioned off into six
departments, to each of which was allotted its Cabildo
and general mechanism of government. These
attempts naturally represented nothing more than a
drop of progress in the ocean of chaos; but there
is no reason to doubt that Artigas undertook the new
and peaceable campaign with no little measure of
whole-heartedness. In any case the new era proved
as fleeting as any of its predecessors. It was the
turn of the Portuguese once again to set in motion
the wheel of fate upon which the destinies of
Uruguay were revolving with such giddy rapidity.</p>

<p>It was in 1816 that the Portuguese invaded
Uruguay for the second time since the natives of
the land had started on their campaign of self-government.
Their armies marched south from
Brazil with the ostensible object of putting an end
to the anarchy that they alleged was rampant under
the rule of Artigas. The condition of the country
was undoubtedly lamentable. Harassed by hordes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
marauding soldiery or acknowledged bandits, the
safety of lives and homes without the more immediate
range of Artigas's influence was even more precarious
than had been the case during the recent period
of wild turmoil.</p>

<p>It is true that in the districts bordering on the headquarters
of the Gaucho chief at Hervidero matters
were very different. Indeed, so severe was the
discipline imposed by the Caudillo, and so terrible the
penalties following on theft, that it is said that beneath
his iron rule a purse of gold might have been left
on the public highway with as little chance of its
removal as though it lay within the vaults of a bank.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the disorder that prevailed
in so many quarters, the disinterestedness of the
motives that caused the Portuguese intervention need
not be taken too seriously. There can be no doubt
that the real object of the invasion was territorial
possession rather than the amelioration of a state
of turbulence that concerned Brazil to a very minor
degree. To this end an imposing army of twelve
thousand men marched southwards, striking Uruguay
at the central point of its northern frontier.</p>

<p>Artigas braced himself for a desperate struggle,
the final result of which could scarcely be doubtful.
In order to distract the attention of the advancing
army he became in turn the invader, and sent a
force northwards to invade the Misiones territory
that, lost to the Banda Oriental, now formed part
of Brazil. The manoeuvre, though adroit, was
rendered futile by the preponderance of the foreign
troops. In a short while the scene of the conflict
was transferred to the home country. Here the
entire collection of Artigas's mixed forces made a
stand. Men of pure Spanish descent, Gauchos, Indians,
negroes, and a sprinkling of emigrant foreigners
beyond&mdash;all these fought with a desperation that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in the first place rewarded by several victories. No
human effort, however, could stave off the final result.
Andresito, a famous Indian leader, Rivera, Latorre,
and Artigas himself were in turn defeated, and in
February of 1817 Lecor, at the head of the Portuguese
army, entered Montevideo in triumph.</p>

<p>The fall of the capital did not end the war.
Throughout the provinces the resistance continued
unabated. On the water, too, the Uruguayans
asserted themselves with no little success, and it is
amazing to read that one or two of their privateers
with the utmost hardihood sailed across the ocean to
the coasts of Portugal itself, making several captures
within sight of the Iberian cliffs. Indeed, that the
authority of Artigas was still recognised to a certain
degree is proved by a treaty between his Government
and Great Britain that was concluded several
months after the loss of Montevideo.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, ere the inevitable complications
arose to render the situation yet more
hopeless. The perennial disputes with Buenos Aires
became embittered to such a degree that Artigas, in
sublime disregard of the Portuguese forces already
in the country, declared war against the Directorate.
The primary outcome of this was the defection of
several of his leaders, who, as a matter of fact, foreseeing
the reckless declaration, had espoused the
Buenos Aires cause just previous to its publication.</p>

<p>The sole hope of Artigas now lay in the provinces
of Entre Rios and Corrientes. Even here had
occurred a wavering that had necessitated a crushing
by force ere a return to allegiance had been brought
about. With these and the remaining Oriental forces
he continued the struggle. But the tide of his fortune
had turned. The beginning of the year 1818
witnessed the capture of two of his foremost lieutenants,
Otorgues and Lavalleja, who were sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
by the Portuguese to an island in the Bay of Rio
de Janeiro. As a last effort, Artigas, daring the
aggressive even at this stage, hurled his intrepid
Gauchos and Misiones Indians once more over the
frontier into Brazilian territory itself. A brilliant
victory was followed by the inevitable retreat in the
face of immensely superior forces. At Tacuarembo,
in the north of the Banda Oriental, fell the blow that
virtually ended the campaign. Here Artigas's army,
under the command of Latorre, was surprised and
completely routed with a loss that left the force non-existent
for practical purposes. Shortly after this
Rivera surrendered to the Portuguese, and with his
submission went the last hope of success.</p>

<p>Artigas crossed the River Uruguay, and took up
a position in Entre Rios. The hour of his doom had
struck; but even then, with his forces shattered
and crushed, he refused to bow to the inevitable.
With extraordinary doggedness he scoured Entre
Rios, Corrientes, and Misiones in an endeavour to
sweep up the remaining few that the battles had
spared, and yet once again to lead them against the
Portuguese. But on this occasion there was no
response. Sullen and despairing, the majority of the
remnant turned from him, and in the end his officer
Ramirez, Governor of Entre Rios, threw off his
allegiance, and came with an expedition to expel
him from the country.</p>

<p>Devoting themselves to this narrowed campaign,
the two Gaucho leaders assailed each other with
fury. Victory in the first instance lay with Artigas,
despite his diminished following. Ramirez, however,
received reinforcements from the Buenos Aires
authorities, who had thrown the weight of their
influence against their old enemy. It was against
the allied forces that Artigas fought his last battle.
When it was evident even to his indomitable spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
that all hope was at an end he marched northwards
with a couple of hundred troops who remained faithful
in the hour of adversity to the once all-powerful
Protector.</p>

<p>At Candelaria he crossed the Paraná, and sought
the hospitality of Gaspar Rodriguez Francia, the
dreaded Dictator of Paraguay. The latter first of all
imprisoned the fugitive&mdash;probably more from force
of habit than from any other reason, since Francia
was accustomed to fill his dungeons as lightly as
a fishwife her basket with herrings.</p>

<p>After a very short period of incarceration, however,
the autocrat came to a definite determination regarding
his attitude towards the fugitive who had sought
his protection. Releasing him, he treated him with
a certain degree of liberality as well as with respect.
Artigas was allotted a humble dwelling in the township
of Curuguaty, far to the north of Asuncion,
and in addition he was granted a moderate pension
upon which to live. Here the old warrior, enjoying
the deep regard of his neighbours, ended his days
in peace, while the tortured Uruguay was incorporated
with Brazil and passed under Portuguese
rule.</p>

<p>The name of Artigas stands for that of the national
hero of Uruguay. Within the frontiers of the River
Plate countries and of Southern Brazil no such introduction
would be necessary, since in those places
have raged controversies as fierce as any of the
battles in which the old warrior took part. To the
average English reader, however, his name is necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
unfamiliar, although it crops up now and again
in the records of travellers who visited South America
during the first quarter of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Artigas was essentially the product of a turbulent
era. Born in 1764, he had remained comparatively
obscure until forty-six years later, when the outbreak
of the South American War of Independence
sent him aloft with dramatic rapidity to a pinnacle of
prominence from which he ruled nations and armies&mdash;with
a result that is yet the subject of considerable
dispute.</p>

<p>Perhaps never did the memory of a man meet
with more honour in his own country, and with less
favour without it. Argentine historians and European
travellers of all nationalities have included him
within the dark fold of the world's great criminals.
From the mill of their analysis Artigas emerges as
a bandit, murderer, traitor, a criminal who seized
with audacity each of his thousand opportunities to
outrage the laws of morality and decency. Apart
from the testimony of the noted historians, two Swiss
naturalists, Rengger and Longchamps, who penetrated
to his country and whose report should be
unbiassed, speak of him as one "whose life has
been only a tissue of horrors, the great instrument
of all the calamities which for ten years fell on the
provinces of the confederation of Rio de la Plata."
These convictions are echoed by a score of other
authorities.</p>

<p>For the other side of the picture it is necessary
to turn to the Uruguayan writers. Their views are
at least as definite and unanimous as the others.
According to one, Eduardo Muñoz Ximinez, "the
austerity of Cato, the purity of Aristides, the temperament
of the Gracchi, the nobility of Camillus,
the generosity of Fabricius&mdash;these virtues, allied to
heroism and determination, have been found united<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
within the breast of none but Artigas." This represents
but a solitary note, typical of the great chorus
of praise that goes up from Uruguay.</p>

<p>Artigas, living, had little concern with compromise;
dead, his spirit seems to have infected his
historians with the same dislike of half-measures.
In other respects this particular strand of history
is as flexible as all the rest. For generations the
feathers of Artigas's fame remained of undisputed
black; now the active protests of the Uruguayans
have initiated a cleansing process that promises to
change the plumes to too blinding a white. Such
impartial judgment as is possible induces the persuasion
that the Argentine and foreign chroniclers,
though writing in all good faith, have erred a little
in relying too much upon the testimony of men who
bore bitter personal enmity towards the Uruguayan
leader. Artigas, in fact, reveals himself from out
of the cloud of conflicting authorities as an essentially
human being, swayed by the passions of the age and
knowing many of its faults, wild as the age itself,
but less sordid and more picturesque, and the author
of some deeds, moreover, that, worked in the light
of a more central and populous field, might well
have sent his name to posterity with more assured
honour.</p>

<p>Artigas was born at a time that, by courtesy, was
termed one of peace. A treaty of the previous year
had for a short while changed the open warfare
between the Spaniards and Portuguese into an unofficial
series of aggressions and frontier skirmishes.
Scarcely, however, had the future Protector of
Uruguay attained to his twelfth year when the war
broke out again, thus adding fresh fuel to the ceaseless
minor hatreds and private feuds. Brought up,
as one of his own apologists admits, in an atmosphere
of rapine, revenge, and violence, the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
surroundings of Artigas were sufficient to prepare
him for the grim part he was destined to play. He
could, moreover, lay claim to an especial sentimental
stake in the country, since forty years before the date
of his birth his grandfather had formed one of the
heads of seven families who were sent from Buenos
Aires in order to found the town of Montevideo.</p>

<p>Artigas, attained to manhood, became noted for
physical prowess. As was inevitable in such a land,
his unequalled tricks of horsemanship and feats of
strength soon gave him an ascendency over the companions
of his own age. Since Artigas himself
vouchsafed little information on the subject, the
details of this early career are at best vague. His
enemies assert that he turned brigand, and captained
a band of desperadoes. It is now practically certain
that this was not the case, but that he devoted himself
to smuggling there is no doubt. It must be
remembered that in those days contraband was not
necessarily a commerce of reproach. Although its
active agents were essentially of a reckless type,
there were others of considerable standing who were
more or less directly interested in a traffic that they
held a legitimate and profitable protest against the
repressive fiscal measures of Spain.</p>

<p>It was in the sparsely populated hill country of
the north that Artigas first learned to control men
and to command expeditions. Once fairly settled
to the work, unusually numerous convoys of laden
horses and mules passed stealthily southwards from
Brazil through the valleys, forests, and streams of
the frontier districts, for the daring ventures of the
Uruguayan leader met with phenomenal success. As
a result his influence steadily increased among both
the men of his own race and the semi-civilised
Indians of the neighbourhood. The personality of
the man with the hawk nose, blue eyes, and fair skin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
possessed the rare faculty of inspiring his followers
with personal affection as well as with admiration.
As the years went on his name began to ring in
every mud cabin and reed hut, and the numbers of
his adherents attained to formidable proportions.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the general disorder of the
country had increased to a pitch that demanded
active measures for its repression. In 1797 the
Spanish authorities raised a special corps of
Blandengues, whose duties were fairly comprehensive.
Picked men, they served as cavalry,
police, as guards against Indian raids, and as a
force to repress the smugglers. Imbued with
a wholesome respect for his power, the Montevidean
Government approached Artigas by way of the line
of least resistance. The Uruguayan accepted an invitation
to join the corps, and soon proved himself
its most capable and efficient officer.</p>

<p>Thus we see Artigas in the blue-and-red uniform
of the Blandengues, armed with a lance that sported
a steel crescent below its point, chasing smugglers
instead of being chased, arresting criminals, fighting
with intruding Brazilians, and slaying rebellious
Indians with the precautionary enthusiasm of the
period. His vindication of justice was now as
thorough as had formerly been his evasion of the
fiscal laws. In 1802 a rapid series of promotion
created him <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Guarda General de la Campaña</i>, or
guardian officer general of the rural districts. We
next hear of him as taking part with his regiment
against the British invaders of the country in 1807.
Then, in 1810, began the South American War of
Independence, and with its outbreak dawned the true
career of the Uruguayan popular hero.</p>

<p>It was not, however, until nine months or so after
the commencement of the campaign that Artigas
threw in his lot with the patriot forces. The immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
cause was a quarrel with his superior officer,
the Spanish General Muesa. Artigas, whose spirit
was not tempered to verbal chastisement, gave back
word for word, until the incensed general threatened
to send him in chains to the neighbouring island of
San Gabriel. That night the offended officer of
Blandengues crossed the broad River Plate in a small
boat, was received with acclamation by the Argentine
leaders, and with their aid prepared an expedition
that should free his country from the Spaniard. The
motives that brought about this sudden adherence
to the party of independence have been much in
dispute. Hostile critics assert that the change of
front was merely vindictive, and that it was the
revengeful fruit of wounded pride that sent him to
the patriot ranks. His supporters declare positively
that the dispute was of importance only in so far
as it gave him reason for the long desired severance
of the link that bound him to the Spanish service.</p>

<p>Be this how it may, the figure of Artigas now
looms with vastly increased bulk from the field of
River Plate history. He is in command of armies
now&mdash;which is the lot of many&mdash;winning battles with
them, moreover, which is the luck of few. His official
rank is that of Colonel, but the title of General is
accorded him by all alike, whether his superiors or
inferiors in grade. As for his own folk of Uruguay,
they have grown to regard him as a being of almost
superhuman power, and follow him with a devoted
affection that speaks well for the temperament of
the leader.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was at this period that the famous
Uruguayan was first enabled to show his true mettle.
His armies knew little of the pomp of war. The
ragged companies looked up to a chief whose garb
was little more warlike and pretentious than their
own. The goodwill, however, that prevailed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
midst of the Uruguayan armies was not shared by the
leaders of the united forces. Jealousy between
Artigas and the Buenos Aires generals had already
caused a breach that political dissensions rapidly
widened. Nations were in the making, and the process
was attended by an almost inevitable bitterness.
Buenos Aires urged a united republic, with its own
town as the centre of government. Artigas strongly
opposed this plan, proposing in its place a bond of
self-governing provinces. Recriminations and threats
were bandied to and fro between the rival patriots
while the Spaniards, though closely besieged, yet
retained Montevideo, and even while the Portuguese
were moving from Brazil to the assistance of the
monarchists.</p>

<p>At length the Portuguese peril loomed sufficiently
large to outweigh every other consideration. With
a view to stemming the foreign tide of invasion, the
Buenos Airens patched up a treaty with the Spanish
troops in Montevideo. The despairing measure was
doubtless one of necessity, but it aroused deep passion
in the mind of the Uruguayan leader, who protested
that his country was forsaken, and given over once
again to the mercies of the Spaniards. Collecting
every available man, woman, and child, he led them
to the north-west, and passed the great exodus over
the River Uruguay to a haven of safety at Ayui, upon
the Entre Rios shore. Meanwhile, Uruguay was
overrun by the invading Portuguese and by the
released Spaniards, who eddied out in all directions
from Montevideo.</p>

<p>Artigas was now encamped for the first time with
a translated nation and an independent army of his
own. The condition of both was grimly tragic,
pathetically humorous. For fourteen months almost
the only shelter, that served for all alike, was afforded
by the branches of the trees and the boards of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
carts that had brought them. As for the army, it
was composed of strangely heterogeneous elements.
Honest countryfolk rubbed shoulders with professional
criminals and cut-throats; Indians from the
destroyed Jesuit missions went side by side with
fierce-faced Gauchos; while townsmen, negroes, and
a few adventurous foreigners made up the mixed
gathering.</p>

<p>The men were in deadly earnest, since the example
of Artigas seems to have inspired even the most
depraved with a spark from his own fire. Had it
been otherwise they would undoubtedly have
succumbed to the disadvantages with which they had
to contend. Arms were scarce. A certain favoured
few were possessed of muskets and swords; but
the weapon in chief use was the lance, the national
arm of River Plate folk, the point of which, here
at Ayui, was usually fashioned from the blade of
shears or a knife, or from the iron of some other
agricultural instrument. Many, however, had perforce
to be content with a long knife, with the lasso
and the sling&mdash;the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">boleadores</i>&mdash;as subsidiary
weapons. Yet even these proved by no means
despicable in the hands of the men whose sole garment
was the ragged remnant of a poncho tied about
the waist, and who exercised with poles in preparation
for the time when a musket should be in their
hands.</p>

<p>It was with the aid of an army such as this that
Artigas would cross the river to make his incursions
among the hills of his native country, and would
engage Portuguese and Spaniards alike in battles
from which the desperate and motley companies of
men would frequently emerge victorious. Artigas
was now assisted by numerous minor chiefs, many
of whom were of a character quite unfitted to stand
the light of day. Otorques and Andresito were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
most noted of these. The methods of the former
were utterly brutal. Although the fact is contradicted,
he is credited by many with the order to
a subaltern officer to "cut the throats of two
Spaniards a week in order to preserve the morale.
Failing Spaniards, take two Buenos Airens for the
purpose"!</p>

<p>Andresito was an Indian from the deserted Jesuit
missions who commanded a considerable force of
his own race. He appears to have interspersed his
dark deeds with some evidence of better qualities
and even of a grim humour. A coarse instance of
this latter is supplied when he entered the town of
Corrientes in the heyday of Artigas's power. On this
occasion the Indian troops behaved with no little
restraint towards the terrified inhabitants, and contented
themselves with levying contributions towards
the clothing of the almost naked army. This accomplished,
Andresito determined to exhibit the social
side of his temperament. He organised several
religious dramas, and followed these by a ball in
honour of the principal residents of the town. These,
however, failed to attend, their reluctance to dancing
with Indians overcoming their prudence. On learning
the reason from some crassly honest person, the
enraged Andresito caused these too particular folk to
be mustered in the main plaza of the town. There
he obliged the men to scour the roadway, while
the ladies were made to dance with the Indian
troops.</p>

<p>Although no merit or subtlety can be claimed
for such methods, they at all events stand apart
from the rest in their lack of bloodthirstiness. Compared
with the sentiments revealed in a proclamation
of Otorgues in taking possession of Montevideo,
the procedure at Corrientes seems innocuous and
tame. One of the clauses of this document decrees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the execution within two hours of any citizen who
should speak or write in favour of any other government,
while the same fate was promised to one "who
should directly or indirectly attack the liberty of the
Province"! The humour in the employment of the
word "liberty" is, of course, totally unconscious.</p>

<p>Such proclamations, naturally, served purely and
simply as a licence for convenient murder. Employing
lieutenants of the kind, it is little wonder that
much of the guilt of their accumulated deeds should
be undeservedly heaped upon Artigas's head. Not
that the Commander-in-Chief himself was inclined to
put a sentimental value upon human life; indeed,
a delicacy on this point would be impossible in one
who had passed through the scenes of his particular
calling. In any case his hatred of robbery was deep-rooted
and sincere. After the execution of three
criminals of this type, he proclaims to his people at
Ayui: "My natural aversion to all crime, especially
to the horrible one of robbery, and my desire that the
army should be composed of honourable citizens
... has moved me to satisfy justice by means of
a punishment as sad as it is effectual." A little
later he makes a similar appeal, adding, "if there
be remaining amongst you one who does not harbour
sentiments of honour, patriotism, and humanity, let
him flee far from the army he dishonours"! Here
we get the flowers of the south, earnestly thrown,
but alighting in too earthy a bed! The poor army,
with its impoverished, ragged loin-cloths, and with
its lassos and slings, undoubtedly valued the occasional
luxury of a full stomach at least as highly
as the abstract virtues. Yet they probably heard
the words with sincere admiration, feeling an added
pride in their beloved leader who could employ such
phrases. In any case&mdash;whether as a result of punishments
or proclamations&mdash;the crime of robbery soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
became rare almost to extinction within the sphere
of Artigas's influence.</p>

<p>The war itself was each month growing more
savage in character. Such virtues as the Uruguayan
army possessed were recognised least of all by the
Spaniards. Elio, the Viceroy, had erected a special
gallows in Montevideo for the benefit of any prisoners
that might be captured, while Vigodet, his successor,
endeavoured to strike terror by measures of pure
barbarity. By his order a body of cavalry scoured
the countryside, slaying all those suspected of Artiguenian
leanings, and exposing the quartered portions
of their bodies at prominent places by the roadside.
Each patriot, moreover, carried a price upon his
head. It is not to be wondered at that the Uruguayan
forces made reprisals, and that corpses replaced
prisoners of war.</p>

<p>A renewed campaign waged by the Buenos Aires
forces against the Spaniards was the signal for the
abandonment of the settlement at Ayui. Once again
the Royalists were shut up within the walls of
Montevideo, and at the beginning of 1813 Artigas,
with his men, marched down from the north to take
part in the siege. The Uruguayan came now as an
assured ruler of his own people; the Buenos Aires
commanders regarded him as a unit in a greater
system. The result was the inevitable quarrel, and
a year from the inception of the operations Artigas
took the most decisive step in his career. He gave
no warning of his move. The evening before had
witnessed his particular portion of the field covered
with horses and men. The next morning saw the
ground bare and deserted: Artigas and his army
were already many leagues away.</p>

To face p. 88.
</p>
</div>

<p>From that moment Artigas became virtual king
of a torn and struggling realm. The Buenos Aires
authorities, incensed at his defection, placed a price<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of six thousand dollars on his head, continuing meanwhile
the siege of Montevideo. Artigas retaliated by
a formal declaration of war upon the central Government.
The hostile ramifications were now sufficiently
involved to satisfy the most warlike spirit. Artigas
was fighting the Buenos Airens and Portuguese, and
was only prevented from coming to close grips with
the Spaniards by the fact that the intervening Buenos
Aires armies had already taken that task upon themselves.
As it was, the influence of the national hero
spread out to the west with an amazing rapidity,
passing beyond the Uruguay River, and holding good
upon the remote side of the great Paraná stream
itself. In a very short while his dominions in Argentine
territory assumed an extent four times greater
than that of his native country. The provinces of
Entre Rios, Corrientes, Santa Fé, and Córdoba welcomed
his new tricolour standard with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Thus Artigas was now ruler of 350,000 square
miles, with the exception of the various odd points
of vantage held by the remaining three contending
powers.</p>

<p>The fall of Montevideo and the final ejection of
the Spaniards from the soil was followed by the
retirement of the Buenos Aires armies to their own
country. Thus to Artigas's realm was added the
necessary complement of a capital and some seagoing
ships that served as the nucleus of a national
navy. The ex-smuggler was now at the zenith of
his power. It is at this point that he affords by
far the most interesting picture, since the amazing
medley of sentiments for which his character was
responsible were now given full play. Caring nothing
for pomp and ceremony, he sent Otorgues to rule
Montevideo, while his other chiefs assumed control
of the various districts throughout the provinces. He
himself, true to his Gaucho upbringing, avoided all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
towns, and finally settled himself in the north-west
of Uruguay. On a tableland by the banks of the
great river, some score of miles to the south of
Salto, he established a camp from which he directed
the policy of the five provinces that owned to his
rule.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of this encampment of
Hervidero was another, in which were confined those
prisoners whose offences were not considered worthy
of immediate death. Serving as it did to cleanse
doubtful minds of rebellion, it was christened by the
euphuistic name of Purificacion. There is no doubt
that the methods employed for this exalted purpose
often ended fatally for the unfortunates experimented
upon. The popular tales of the deeds done at both
encampments are extraordinarily revolting. Two
phrases of jocular slang then much in use throw a
lurid light upon the callousness of the period. "To
play the violin" referred to the cutting of a human
throat; "to play the viola" signified the severance
of a live man's body&mdash;both gruesomely accurate
similes. Men are said to have been flung wholesale
into the river, attached to stones, and a peculiarly
agonising form of death was engineered in the sewing
up of a living victim in the hide of a freshly killed
bullock, which was then exposed to the sun. The
result was shrinkage, and suffocation for the miserable
wretch within the reeking covering, an ending
that was dubbed "the waistcoat" by a touch of
similar humour. Numerous evidences of individuality,
moreover, were evident in the various forms
of punishment. Thus a certain Colonel Perugorria,
who lay under a charge of treason, was, until his
execution, chained to a post, as though he were a
dog, by means of an iron collar round his neck, to
which the steel links were attached.</p>

<p>Many of Artigas's supporters roundly deny the perpetration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of these horrors; yet there is little doubt
that many such acts were committed throughout the
various provinces. To what extent they received
the sanction of Artigas is far more uncertain. The
probability is that he strongly discouraged wanton
torture, although it lay beyond even such powers as
his to hold back the Gaucho passions when they
were fiercest and to prevent the merciless acts of
revenge. Many eye-witnesses have related that he
exhibited emotion and pity at the sight of a humanely
conducted execution.</p>

<p>Indeed, there is no reason to suppose that Artigas,
for all his errors and limitations, was not a true
believer in the very lofty sentiments he used to
express. One of the many examples of these is to
be met with in his letter to the local authorities of
Montevideo, when in 1815 they endowed him with the
title of Captain-General, with the addition of that
of "Protector and Patron of the Liberty of the
Nation." Artigas, refusing the honour, which, nevertheless,
remained attached to him, says: "Titles
are the phantoms of States, and the glory of upholding
liberty suffices for your illustrious corporation.
Let us teach our countrymen to be virtuous.
For this reason I have retained until now the rank
of a simple citizen ... the day will come when
men will act from a sense of duty, and when they
will devote their best interests to the honour of their
fellow-men."</p>

<p>The simplicity of Artigas was innate and genuine.
One of his own nationality, on a visit to Hervidera,
describes the costume of the dreaded leader. On
that occasion Artigas was content with the plain
costume of a countryman&mdash;plain blue jacket and
pantaloons, white stockings, and a skin cloak, all
rather shabby. The paraphernalia of a meal was of
similar quality, and in addition lamentably scanty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Broth, a stew of meat, and roast beef were served
on a couple of pewter dishes with broken edges;
a single cup took the place of non-existent wine-glasses;
no more than three earthenware plates could
be mustered, and, since the seating accommodation
was restricted to three chairs and a hide box, the
majority of the guests had perforce to stand. Such
were the clothes and household goods of the lord
of five provinces, whose armies were battling with
Portuguese Peninsular War veterans and with Argentine
battalions, whose vessels had borne his flag to
Europe to harass hostile vessels off the coasts of
Portugal itself, who made treaties with England and
other powers, and whose name was all but
worshipped by a hundred thousand people!</p>

<p>J. P. Robertson, an English chronicler of the
period, gives an interesting account of a meeting
with Artigas. Assaulted and robbed by a band of
the noted chief's adherents, he boldly set out for
Purificacion to claim redress. His words deserve
quotation at some length. "I came to the Protector's
headquarters," he says, "of the so-called
town of Purificacion. And there (I pray you do not
turn sceptic on my hands) what do you think I saw?
Why, the most excellent Protector of half the New
World, seated on a bullock's skull, at a fire kindled
on the mud floor of his hut, eating beef off a spit,
and drinking gin out of a cow horn! He was surrounded
by a dozen officers in weather beaten attire,
in similar positions, and similarly occupied with their
chief. All were smoking, all gabbling. The Protector
was dictating to two secretaries, who occupied,
at one deal table, the only two dilapidated rush
bottom chairs in the hovel. To complete the singular
incongruity of the scene, the floor of the one apartment
of the mud hut (to be sure it was a pretty
large one) in which the general, his staff, and secretaries,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
were assembled, was strewn with pompous
envelopes from all the Provinces (some of them distant
some 1,500 miles from that centre of operations)
addressed to 'His Excellency the Protector.' At the
door stood the reeking horses of couriers arriving
every half hour, and the fresh ones of those departing
as often.... His Excellency the Protector,
seated on his bullock's skull, smoking, eating,
drinking, dictating, talking, dispatched in succession
the various matters brought under his notice with
that calm, or deliberate, but uninterrupted nonchalance,
which brought most practically home to
me the truth of the axiom, 'Stop a little that we
may get on the faster.'... He received me, not
only with cordiality, but with what surprised me
more, comparatively gentlemanlike manners, and
really good breeding.... The Protector's business
was prolonged from morning till evening, and so were
his meals; for, as one courier arrived another was
dispatched, and as one officer rose up from the fire
at which the meat was spitted another took his place."</p>

<p>The General politely took his visitor the round
of his hide huts and mud hovels, where the horses
stood saddled and bridled day and night, and where
the tattered soldiery waited in readiness for the
emergencies that arose so frequently. When
Robertson submitted his financial claim, Artigas remained
as amiable as before. "'You see,' said the
General with great candour and nonchalance, 'how
we live here; and it is as much as we can do, in these
hard times, to compass beef, aguardiente, and cigars.
To pay you 6,000 dollars just now is as much beyond
my power, as it would be to pay you 60,000 or
600,000. Look here,' said he, and so saying, he
lifted up the lid of an old military chest, and pointed
to a canvas bag at the bottom of it. 'There,' he
continued, 'is my whole stock of cash; it amounts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to 300 dollars; and where the next supply is to come
from I am as little aware as you are.'" Notwithstanding
this, Robertson then and there obtained
some trading concessions that, he says, repaid him
the amount of his claim many times over.</p>

<p>Surely this picture reveals Artigas more truly than
all the long-winded polemics that have raged about
the famous Uruguayan. It is given by one whose
sympathies were against the aims of the Gaucho
chief, and who has proved himself no lenient critic.
Yet the description fits no mere cut-throat and plunderer.
On the contrary, it reveals a virile
personality, a thinker and worker of a disposition
that goes far to explain the adoration accorded
him by his troops. Artigas, at the hands of
the visitor who had sufficient cause for his ridicule,
comes to light as a <em>man</em>&mdash;contemptuous of poverty,
misery, and sordid surroundings so long as his goal
remained as clear and distinct as it ever was to his
sight.</p>

<p>The picture is not without its pathetic side. It
shows Artigas in the heyday of his power, yet even
then hard put to it to supply his men with clothes
and the common necessities of life. Imagine the
calm force and philosophy of a being capable of
governing more than a third of a million square
miles of territory with the assistance of a treasury
of three hundred dollars! Nevertheless, these <i lang="fr" xml:lang="frs">opéra
bouffe</i> conditions represented the highest point of
material prosperity to which Artigas ever attained.
For five years he ruled thus, grappling desperately
with the invading Brazilian armies, and resisting the
efforts of the Buenos Aires forces to regain control
of the four Argentine provinces that had espoused
his cause.</p>

<p>With a prosperity thus frugally marked, it is easy
to conceive the circumstances of the adversity that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
was to come. To their credit be it said that the
Uruguayans faltered not in the least in the face of
the ultimate doom that must have appeared inevitable.
As their ranks became steadily thinned,
the invading hordes of Portuguese soldiers swelled
in numbers, while the Buenos Aires attacks on the
river provinces became yet more determined. Yet,
wanting in everything, its more capable and intelligent
officers prisoners of war, the Uruguayans
fought on to the very end&mdash;gaunt, haggard men who
gave back blow for blow, though their courage was
often sustained by no other means than the chewing
of strips of hide. One of the officers of a regiment
of lancers, once the pride of the army, describes
the condition of the men in the last days of the
struggle. At reveille, on a chilly winter's morning,
each trooper would supplement the loin-cloth that
alone remained to him by a whole cowhide. Thus
when their backs were turned as they retired to
their quarters, the number of men could only be
judged by the quantity of moving cowhides!</p>

<p>Even then the final hour might have been indefinitely
postponed but for the revolt of Ramirez, one
of Artigas's own chieftains. After a homeric struggle,
Ramirez obtained the victory over his old leader, and
pursued him relentlessly through the provinces of
Corrientes and Misiones. It was by this incessant
chase alone that the victor retained his superiority.
For such was the popularity of Artigas that a few
days' halt sufficed for a number of fresh Gauchos
and Indians to join him. When he had escaped from
his penultimate defeat, accompanied by only twelve
men, his pursuer lost touch with him for a week.
At the end of that time the veteran had collected
over nine hundred men, and was besieging Cambay,
one of Ramirez's strongholds. A division was sent
off post-haste to the spot, and it was here that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
old warrior fought his last fight. Artigas, leaving
most of his men dead upon the field, fled northwards
and passed into Paraguay.</p>

<p>The later years of Artigas present the strangest
contrast to his early life. Received and sheltered
after some hesitation by Francia, the dreaded tyrant
of Paraguay, he was first allotted a dwelling in the
north of the country, and was afterwards permitted
to dwell in the neighbourhood of Asuncion, the
capital. Here he lived in complete retirement and
peace until his death occurred, at the advanced age
of eighty-three. Both his time and the small pension
allowed him by the Paraguayan Government were
spent in relieving the wants of his neighbours, by
whom he was regarded with affection and veneration.
The keynote to the true Artigas undoubtedly lies
in these last years, when in humble tranquillity he
had leisure at length to practise the benevolence
and charity that he had so often preached from a
corpse-surrounded pulpit. Difficult as it is to withdraw
the personality of Artigas from the sea of blood
that flooded his age, he was surely a product of an
anarchical period rather than of anarchy itself.</p>

<p>The end of the year 1824 witnessed the extinction
of the last vestige of the power of Spain in South
America. With one solitary exception, each former
Spanish colony had now raised itself to the status of
a nation. It is true that in the majority of cases
the inhabitants of these countries suffered not only
the wildest of anarchy, but in addition a degree of
despotism that had been unknown during the Spanish
régime, for all the selfishness of the Peninsula
Government. Yet since the flock of tyrants that
rose up, each like a grim phoenix, from the ashes
of the Spanish Dominion were conceived of the
tortured countries themselves, the South Americans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
took such small comfort as they might from a dim
reflection that in their own hands lay the possibility
of the improvement in the rulers born from their
own bone.</p>

<p>Of these States thus freed from any other despotism
but of their own making Uruguay formed the sole
exception. For years she had remained beneath the
heel of Portugal, writhing uneasily, but unable to
remove the weight of the foreign occupation. When
the time came for the full independence of the rest,
however, Uruguay's longing to acquire their State was
no longer to be repressed, even at the cost of the
expulsion of the second European power that had
fixed upon the land.</p>

<p>The man whose name stands out as the liberator
of Uruguay for the second time is Juan Antonio
Lavalleja. Ceding place only to Artigas as a national
hero, Lavalleja had fought in many actions against
the Spaniards, and had distinguished himself not a
little in the original revolutionary wars. Alternate
military and civil occupations have nearly always
fallen to the lot of South American public men, and
Lavalleja formed no exception to the rule. At the
time when the victory of Ayacucho in Peru crowned
the entire campaign against the Spaniards he held
the comparatively humble and prosaic post of
manager of a meat-curing factory in the neighbourhood
of Buenos Aires.</p>

<p>The rejoicings that the victory of Ayacucho
aroused in the capital of Argentina stirred to the
depth both Lavalleja and a company of fellow-exiles
from the Banda Oriental. A meeting of these
patriots was held on the spot, the result of which
was an enthusiastic determination to place their own
country upon the same footing as the rest. Doubtless
many hundreds of similar gatherings had already
been effected&mdash;and concluded by vapourings of thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
air. But the spirit of these men who had thus come
together was of another kind. Having sworn
solemnly to free their country, action followed hotfoot
on the heels of words. A couple of their number
were sent at once to Uruguay to prepare the minds
of a trusted few, while the rest made preparations
for the expedition that was to follow.</p>

<p>The mission of the two deputies proved successful.
They returned to Buenos Aires, the bearers of many
promises of support and co-operation. Nothing now
remained but to take the first irrevocable step in the
campaign that was to bloom out from this very
humble seed.</p>

<p>"Treinta y Tres" has now developed into a proper
name in the Banda Oriental; for the number of men
who started out from Buenos Aires for the sake of
Uruguay was thirty-three. The name has now been
locally immortalised. Among the infinite variety of
objects that it endows may be counted a province, a
town, innumerable plazas and streets, and a brand of
cigarettes.</p>

<p>There is certainly nothing that is intrinsically
humorous in the adventures of these noble men who
set out for their patriotic purpose in the face of
such terrible risks. Yet as a specimen of the constitution
of the armies of the South American factions
at this period a survey of the grades held by
the small gathering is illuminating. In the first
place the diminutive expedition had for its Commander-in-Chief
Colonel Juan Antonio Lavalleja,
who had beneath him three majors and four captains.
These in turn were supported by three lieutenants,
an ensign, a sergeant, a corporal, and a guide. The
remaining eighteen constituted the rank and file of
the force&mdash;in fact, the Army proper.</p>

<p>The little expedition so overwhelmingly officered
set out from Buenos Aires, proceeding northward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
along the Argentine shore. Reaching a point where
the river had become comparatively narrow, they
embarked in small boats, and launched out on the
Uruguay at dead of night. A gale obliged them to
seek refuge on a friendly island, and caused a day's
delay. But the next evening they embarked once
more, and reached in safety the beach of La
Agraciada on their native shore. There they unfurled
their chosen tricoloured banner, and swore
once again to attain liberty or death.</p>

<p>The expedition was now actually on the scene of its
mission, and shortly after daybreak it began its march
to the north. During the course of a few hours they
collected <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> reinforcements of forty able-bodied
and armed Orientales.</p>

<p>Proceeding steadily onwards, the gallant little
army, officers and all, found itself in the neighbourhood
of the small town of Dolores, better known
formerly as San Salvador. This was held by a
garrison of eighty men in the service of Brazil.
Determined to inflict a first decisive blow, Lavalleja
led his men onwards to the attack. The moment
chanced to be especially propitious, since the officers
and principal men in the town had attended a dance
on the previous night. So great had been the delights
of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">baile</i> that the principal men had found it
necessary to continue their repose long into the
morning&mdash;a circumstance that is not unknown even
to this day.</p>

<p>Had it not been for an error on the part of the
patriot guide the town would undoubtedly have been
captured by surprise and taken almost without a
blow. As it was, the official chanced to mistake the
situation of a ford in an intervening small river. This
necessitated a lengthy march along the banks ere a
place suitable for the passage was found, and the
presence of the small company with the tricoloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
flag was discovered with amazement by the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Thus ere Lavalleja's expedition had succeeded in
crossing the stream there had been moments of wild
bustle in Dolores. Officers sprang out of bed to gird
on their swords in haste; soldiers ran to assemble
with uniforms even more than usually awry, while
the municipal officers doubtless ran to and fro in
aimless confusion. Nevertheless by the time that the
turmoil was at an end the garrison had had an opportunity
to muster, and to sally out against the
advancing band that had not yet gained the town.</p>

<p>Since the Portuguese forces were under the command
of an Oriental, Colonel Julián Laguna, a parley
took place ere the two forces met. In the end,
Laguna deciding to remain staunch to the foreign
cause, the thirty-three and their allies charged,
routing the enemy completely. Thus in the course of
their first victory they won not only the town of
Dolores itself, but a number of Uruguayan volunteers
who joined them from out of the beaten force.</p>

<p>The thirty-three with their companions, delaying
a very short while in the captured town, continued
their march. A more pressing danger now menaced
them. General Rivera, the Oriental who, having so
distinguished himself in the former wars against the
Portuguese, had entered the latter service when the
Uruguayan cause became lost, was sent out with a
force of seventy men to annihilate the daring
aggressors. Here, again, when numbers and rank
are compared, it will be seen that the regular forces
of the country were more or less on a par with the
thirty-three in their generosity in the matter of
titles.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, however it was commanded, the
thirty-three were destined to gain yet further support
from the force detached against them. On his near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
approach to the devoted band, Rivera's patriotic
instincts overcame all other considerations. At
a meeting contrived between him and Lavalleja
the pair embraced, and Rivera forsook the Brazilian
service on the spot to join the cause of his country.
The addition to their ranks of the famous fighter and
his men was naturally greeted with enthusiasm by
the patriots, who advanced filled with renewed confidence.
On the other hand, the news of the defection
created no little consternation among the Brazilians,
who set a price upon the heads of both Rivera and
Lavalleja, valuing the former at five hundred dollars
more than the fifteen hundred offered for Lavalleja,
although the latter remained the actual commander
of the expedition.</p>

<p>The thirty-three had now abandoned their cautious
north-west fringing of the coast. With their numbers
increasing as they went, they struck for the south-east,
making boldly for Montevideo itself, and defeating
the various Portuguese forces that strove to oppose
them.</p>

<p>Arrived at length at San José, some three score
miles distant from Montevideo, Lavalleja determined
on an especially daring move that proved his appreciation
of the value of prestige. From there he sent
all his prisoners with a strong guard under Rivera to
Durazno, and at Canelones, farther on, he detached
another party to obtain recruits from the neighbourhood
of Maldonado. He himself, accompanied now
by no more than a hundred men, continued in
supreme unconcern his march to Montevideo.
Arriving upon the outskirts of the spot, he encamped
on the Cerrito de la Victoria, whence, employing a
colossal piece of bluff, he set himself to besiege
the city.</p>

<p>It is surely not often that a hundred men have sat
down to invest a fortified town garrisoned by nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
two thousand soldiers. Yet it was in the amazing
effrontery of the proceeding that success lay. On the
very next day a strong force of the enemy, numbering
over fifteen hundred men with four guns, sallied out
from Montevideo. The hundred besiegers must
doubtless have thought that all was lost; but,
continuing the grim farce to the end, they opened fire
to the best of their ability upon the advancing
columns. The result more than fulfilled their most
sanguine expectations. Convinced that the furious
fusillade emanated from a powerful army, the
Portuguese columns retired into the town, while the
hundred men sat down again to continue the siege of
Montevideo.</p>

<p>But their number did not now long remain at this
ridiculously inadequate total. By twos and tens and
even by hundreds the Orientales escaped from the
city, flocking to the tricolour banner until the patriot
army had swollen to a degree that rendered it formidable
in fact as well as in fancy. So successful, moreover,
had proved Rivera's mission in the Campo that
in a few days almost the whole of Uruguay was in
arms against the enemy's forces in its midst.</p>

<p>The work of the thirty-three had been extraordinarily
rapid. So successful, indeed, had been the
campaign that, in the place of disputing against
another's authority, the moment had arrived for
setting up their own, against which it should be
treason to contend.</p>

<p>In order to effect this Lavalleja withdrew
personally from the siege of Montevideo, and
established an independent government at the town
of Florida to the north of the capital. Moved by
a truly lofty sense of patriotism, he handed over his
leadership to the new authorities, who responded by
creating him General-in-Chief of the Army of Liberation,
and by endowing Rivera with the rank of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Inspector-General. On this occasion the titles
conveyed some material significance, since the
Uruguayan Army now amounted to two thousand five
hundred men.</p>

<p>The opening of this new Senate was attended by
a dramatic incident. In order to be present at the
assembly it was necessary for Lavalleja to leave the
front of hostilities and to ride through rain and mud
to Florida.</p>

<p>Ere entering the Hall of Assembly he was met by
several ladies, amongst whom was the wife of Rivera,
who begged him to change his dripping costume
before he proceeded with the official business.
"Thank you, señoras," replied Lavalleja, "I will
attend to that as soon as our country has its government."
Within a few minutes the consummation had
been achieved, and Lavalleja was in dry clothes. The
story affords only one more instance of the numerous
inevitable satellites that attend the passage of a
notable name through the ages; but here the
ingenuous simplicity of the tale is almost sufficient
in itself to vouch for its truth. At this point,
properly speaking, ends the story of the thirty-three.
Beneath the national edifice that they had built up the
minor members of the devoted band had already
become lost to view. The control of affairs was now
vested in a Senate and Corporations, and Argentina,
hastening to recognise the existence of the independent
Government, sent her armies to its assistance,
stipulating that in exchange for the alliance Uruguay
should become one of the provinces of the River
Plate.</p>

<p>With the survival of the first perils, moreover, the
cohesion of the leaders of the famous thirty-three
passed away. During the course of the final battles
against the Portuguese a rivalry sprang into existence
between Lavalleja and Rivera that gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
deepened into a jealous antagonism that has left its
mark of bitterness upon the country to this day.</p>

<p>With the growing certainty of the success of the
cause, and, consequently, of the honours and power in
store for the chosen few among the patriot ranks
dissension and suspicion became rampant. One of
the more immediate outcomes of this regrettable
state was the falling under suspicion of Rivera.
Accused of opening up negotiations with the Portuguese,
he was sent to Buenos Aires for trial.
Acquitted by President Rivadavia of traitorous intent,
he was, nevertheless, held in prison owing to his
outspoken federal views, which were in direct opposition
to the unitarian doctrines of Argentina. After a
while, however, he escaped from captivity, and,
collecting an army, completely re-established his
reputation by invading and conquering the Misiones
districts that were then in the power of the Portuguese.
Although the territory was in the end ceded
back again, the invasion was of material effect in
concluding the war.</p>

<p>When, moreover, after the rout of the Portuguese
fleet by the Argentine Admiral Brown, and the series
of victories that culminated in the battle of Ituzaingo,
it became evident that the expulsion of the Portuguese
from Uruguayan soil was now inevitable within
a very short time, Lavalleja did not wait for any
definite conclusion of peace. In October of 1827,
when, as a matter of fact, the terms of an armistice
were still in dispute, he deposed the national Junta,
and without further ado declared himself Dictator
of his country. This office he held until July of the
following year, when he voluntarily resigned from
the post.</p>

<p>August witnessed a formal acknowledgment of
the independence of Uruguay by both Argentina and
Brazil, and in November a provisional Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
was established. On May 1, 1829, the national
authorities, amidst no little pomp and ceremony, made
a formal entry into Montevideo, and Uruguay was at
last definitely left to the care of its own rulers.</p>

<p>For the purpose of a self-contained romance with
a popular ending, the adventures of the leaders of
the thirty-three should end at the moment when the
liberation of the Banda Oriental became a dawning
certainty, but history has an unfortunate knack of
continuing where fiction ceases. The fiercest enemy
of a hero is longevity.</p>

<p>In this case the phase is especially lamentable,
since although daring deeds of arms persisted, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
feats were wrought, not in a joint cause against
a common enemy, but amidst a turbulent confusion
of sudden alliances and yet more rapid breaches
between friends and neighbours that rendered impossible
speculation whence the tide of battle would
flow next.</p>

<p>The three names that stood out from the very
midst of the chaos of events were those of Lavalleja,
Rivera, and Oribe. Since the three had fought
shoulder to shoulder for their country's redemption
this prominence was only fitting and just. Yet the
rôle of each of the three differed widely now from
his previous methods. Cohesion had departed with
the enemy's forces: not so the tale of the battlefields,
that multiplied until they stained the soil of
the country a deeper red than ever before.</p>

<p>The first few months of complete independence
gave no inkling of what was to come. After one
or two politicians had held interim offices, General
Rondeau, who had rendered great services to
Uruguay, was made Governor. A disagreement,
however, arose between him and the constitutional
assembly. As a result he resigned his post, and
departed to Buenos Aires, shaking the dust of the
Banda Oriental from his feet.</p>

<p>Lavalleja was now invested with the chief office
of the land. Alas for the difference between the
striver after liberty and the sitter in the goddess's
chair! Viewed from the lofty pedestal, freedom
became distant far below and lost to sight. In
short, Lavalleja became a dictator of the most
arbitrary type from the very beginning of his
authority. He muzzled the Press, such as it was,
disbanded various battalions suspected of loyalty to
his private interests, and then turned upon Rivera,
his old comrade-in-arms. Not satisfied with depriving
the latter of his office of Commandant-General,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Lavalleja raised an army, and, intent upon
destruction, marched against the man whom he feared
as his most dangerous rival.</p>

<p>The despotic Governor was not mistaken in his
estimate of Rivera's power. Indeed, the result of
a battle would have been extremely doubtful, had
the two forces come into conflict. But the strenuous
efforts of several peaceful commissions ended in a
reconciliation between the leaders&mdash;a mere loose
patching up of differences, it is true, but one that
served for the time being. In the meanwhile the
Constitution of independent Uruguay was established
and sworn to, the event being greeted by the populace
with wild enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The new State was, of course, endowed with a
President, whose chair remained to be occupied. As
was inevitable, the two candidates for the high post
were Generals Lavalleja and Rivera. Both were,
perhaps, almost equally secure in the admiration of
the nation. Nevertheless, the distinctions between
the temperaments of the two were marked. Rivera
was a democrat, a friend of the populace, whom
he captivated by his intimacy and easy manner.
Lavalleja's tendencies were, by comparison, aristocratic;
yet it is doubtful whether he lost much in
influence from his loftier pose.</p>

<p>The first legislative act of the National Assembly
came as a bitter blow to Lavalleja. In October
of 1830 that body elected as President General
Rivera. As a nation Uruguay had now blossomed
out into a full-blown Constitution. But the youthful
constitutional flower was destined to suffer an
almost continuous winter of frosts. It was beyond
the limits of Lavalleja's forbearance to sit quietly
by and to see his rival comfortably installed in the
coveted chair of state. It was not long ere the
machinery of plots was set in motion. The first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
attempt proved all but successful. Rivera, accompanied
only by a few men, chanced to be in the
small town of Durazno, suspecting nothing, when a
force of five hundred of his enemies descended suddenly
upon the place. Their object was the capture
of the President, who only escaped by leaping through
a window and by swimming across the River Yi.
A rising of the Charrúa Indians was the next material
fruit of the campaign of intrigue; but the rebellion
served no other end than the practical extirpation
of the remnant of the aboriginal race that had
survived until then.</p>

<p>Very shortly after this a revolutionary movement
was instigated in Montevideo itself. Headed by
Colonel Garzon, who held in his pocket a commander-in-chief's
commission from Lavalleja, the
rising was temporarily successful. The National
Assembly, intimidated, had already confirmed the
appointment of Lavalleja as President, when Perez,
the Vice-President, resisted, and the rest, encouraged
by his example, made a firm stand. As a result,
Lavalleja himself made his appearance in Montevideo,
and, with his followers, occupied the municipal
buildings. After an exchange of shots, however, he
and his band were forced to retire.</p>

<p>During the course of these events Rivera had been
absent from the town. On receiving the news he
hastened back from the country, and, placing himself
at the head of an army, set out in strenuous
pursuit of Lavalleja. The latter was overtaken at
Tupambay. A battle ended in the shattering of his
company, and, closely pursued by the President,
Lavalleja fled across the northern border and sought
shelter in Brazil.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the famous Rosas had come to
power in Argentina, and the policy of this dictator
was destined to awaken very material echoes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Uruguay. Lending support to Lavalleja, he sent
a force of three hundred men across the river. In
order to create a diversion, these captured the town
of Melo from the Government party. Their triumph
was fleeting. Beaten shortly afterwards by Rivera
in person, the invading force fled to Brazil.</p>

<p>But the end of the tide of invasion had not yet
come. At the beginning of 1834 Lavalleja, aided
by further contingents furnished by Rosas, descended
once more from the north into his native country.
On this occasion the events of his former attempt
were repeated with equally disastrous results to himself.
Beaten once again, he sought Brazil, the
sheltering spot of all the atoms of Uruguayan
turbulence.</p>

<p>A little after this the four years of Rivera's term
of office expired. It was now the turn of another
of the thirty-three, General Manuel Oribe, to enter
the arena. Oribe was a warrior as well seasoned
as the others. He had fought strenuously under
Artigas's standard; but at the coming of the crisis,
declaring that he could no longer serve under such
a tyrant, he joined the Buenos Aires cause. Later,
he had formed one of the most prominent members
of the thirty-three. Becoming embroiled in the
disputes of the period, he had found himself in
opposition to Rivera, although he had to thank the
President for promotion in rank.</p>

<p>In March of 1835 General Manuel Oribe was
created the second constitutional President of the
Republic. One of his first cares was to undermine
the weighty influence of Rivera, in whose power he
saw a menace to his own office. The new President
began the campaign by summoning back to their
country all those <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Lavallejistas</i> who had been living
in forced exile in Brazil and Argentina. Then, in
order to deliver a death-blow to a rival's prestige,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
he deprived the late President of his rank of
commandant-general.</p>

<p>Exasperated beyond endurance at this latter move,
Rivera immediately made his appeal to the only
authority that was understood at the period&mdash;that
of arms. The insurrection attained almost immediately
to formidable proportions. Indeed, there is
no doubt that the malcontent cause would have been
successful almost immediately had not Rosas intervened.
As it was, the Dictator sent over from
Argentina to the assistance of the Government five
hundred troops, under the command of Lavalleja,
who had thrown in his lot with Oribe against his
arch-rival.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to the actual hostilities Oribe
sent forth a thunderous proclamation, in which
Rivera was branded as a traitor to his country.
The first battle ended in favour of the Government,
the forces of the rebellion leaving over two
hundred dead upon the field. The chief historical
importance of the contest, however, lies in the fact
that on this occasion were used for the first time
the red and the white colours that distinguished the
respective forces of Rivera and Oribe and that have
ever since remained the emblems of bitter strife.</p>

<p>The fortune of war varied for a while. After
numerous indecisive skirmishes, Rivera won an
action at Yucutuja, while a month later Oribe was
successful in a battle on the banks of the River
Yi. Then followed the decisive battle of Palmar,
from which the Government forces emerged no
longer as an army, but merely as a scattering of
fugitive stragglers.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile foreign influence, in addition to
the lot of war, had veered in favour of the revolution.
The arbitrary methods of Rosas, extended to
foreigners resident within the land, had caused him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to become embroiled with France. Thus the northern
power, in addition to the institution of a blockade
of Buenos Aires port, was only too glad of the
opportunity of frustrating the plans of the Argentine
despot in Uruguay. Allying their forces with those of
the revolutionists, they captured the island of Martin
Garcia from the Government troops, and were preparing
further active measures of aggression when
Oribe realised the hopelessness of his plight.
Adopting the sole course that was left him, he
resigned his office of President, and sailed for
Buenos Aires, accompanied by his late ministers, and
a considerable following of private friends.</p>

<p>Rivera's road to the return of power was now
clear. In November of 1838 he made a triumphal
entry into Montevideo, and in due course the National
Assembly elected him President for the second time.
One of the first acts of the new chief of the State
was the avenging of Rosas' late interference in favour
of his rival. Allying himself with the French Government
and the Province of Corrientes, he declared
war&mdash;not against the worthy Argentine nation, as
was carefully explained in the proclamation, but
against the "tyrant of the immortal people of South
America."</p>

<p>Rosas was never slow in responding to a challenge
of the kind. Scarcely had the declaration of
hostilities been made when he sent an army of six
thousand men to invade Uruguay. Rivera, his forces
strengthened by a thousand French volunteers,
marched to meet the enemy, and at Cagancha he
obtained a signal victory, the Argentine troops being
defeated with heavy loss, and thus forced to abandon
their campaign in Uruguay.</p>

<p>It seemed as though the event had put the seal
upon Uruguay's success. But the fortunes of the
period were as erratic as the period was turbulent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Very shortly after the Battle of Cagancha the differences
between Rosas and the French were settled,
with the result that an armistice was effected. With
the raising of the blockade of Buenos Aires and
the departure of the French troops from the country,
it was the turn of Rosas to laugh, for his enemy
now stood before him single-handed.</p>

<p>On this occasion the first aggressive steps were
taken by the naval forces. In 1841 the Argentine
fleet, under Admiral Brown, made a practical end
to Uruguayan sea power. Some minor vessels that
were subsequently collected were given in charge
of the Italian Garibaldi, and the famous guerilla
leader carried on with them a war of privateering,
without, however, meeting with any material
success.</p>

<p>In a desperate attempt to stem the formidable
tide of Rosas's power, the three provinces of
Corrientes, Entre Rios, and Santa Fé allied themselves
with Uruguay. From the joint States Rivera
raised an army of seven thousand men. But even
this heroic effort did not suffice. Boldly marching
through Entre Rios towards Buenos Aires, Rivera
found himself brought to an abrupt halt by the unexpected
appearance before him of his old enemy,
Oribe, at the head of an imposing army of fourteen
thousand men. The ensuing battle, fiercely fought,
ended in an overwhelming victory for the superior
forces, nearly a thousand of Rivera's men being
massacred in cold blood on the conclusion of the
fight.</p>

<p>The beaten President retired from Entre Rios with
the remnants of his army, while Oribe likewise
crossed the Uruguay River, and marched leisurely
southwards from Salto towards Montevideo. In due
time his armies arrived before the capital, which
they forthwith proceeded to invest, thus commencing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the great siege of the place that endured for nine
years.</p>

<p>The circumstances of the beleaguering are too
numerous and complicated to bear recapitulation
here. One of the most notable features of the
earlier days was a proclamation issued by Oribe
to the effect that he would spare no foreigners whose
sympathies lay with the "rebels," as he termed the
Government of Rivera&mdash;or rather of Joaquín Suárez,
who had taken the defeated President's post in
Montevideo. The result of the proclamation was
exactly the reverse of that anticipated by Oribe, since
the foreigners responded by raising legions of their
own and by flocking to the active defence of the
town. The capital, however, was closely invested
by sea as well as by land, Garibaldi's flotilla finding
itself unable to make any headway against Admiral
Brown's blockading fleet.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Rivera had not been idle. With
the amazing recuperative power that was characteristic
of so many of the noted leaders of the period
he had scraped together from the countryside a force
of nearly four thousand men. With these he harassed
the rear of the besieging force to such effect that
the Buenos Aires Government, in order to leave the
blockade undisturbed, raised a fresh army, and sent
it, under the command of General Urquiza, to cope
with the unexpected source of danger.</p>

<p>Urquiza came up with Rivera at India Muerta,
and the result was fatal to the Uruguayan force.
The end of a desperate conflict saw nearly a thousand
of Rivera's men lying dead upon the Campo. In
accordance with the drastically conclusive methods
of the age, the number of prisoners was small by
comparison. As to the surviving remnant, it was
scattered to the four winds on the face of the
downlands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The terrible defeat of India Muerta deprived
Rivera of his military prestige and Uruguay of her
last hope of aggressive warfare. Cooped up in
Montevideo, the Government appealed in despair for
foreign intervention. England and France, viewing
the policy of Rosas with dislike, complied with the
request. But in the end their interference proved
futile, although the combined European forces went
the length of blockading the Argentine ports, and
of defeating Rosas's troops on the banks of the
Paraná.</p>

<p>Rivera in the meanwhile had fallen upon evil days.
His last defeat had involved him in straits that went
beyond even the loss of men and power. The fatal
day won for him, unjustly enough as it proved, the
active suspicion of his own people. Doubtful of
his loyalty, the Montevideo Government applied to
Brazil for his banishment to Rio de Janeiro. The
petition was acceded to; but the Uruguayan leader
seemed a veritable human phoenix in his ability to
spring undismayed from the ashes of each successive
disaster. With the ultimate object of taking
an active part once again in his country's defence,
he succeeded in getting himself appointed by
Montevideo as Minister Plenipotentiary to Paraguay.</p>

<p>Rivera, however, had no intention of proceeding
to take up his office. Once free of Brazil, he sailed
boldly down the river to Montevideo, and raised the
popular opinion of the capital so much in his favour
that, after a short period of disturbance in the
beleaguered city, he was once again endowed with
trust and command. He took himself forthwith to
the Campo, where he resumed his warlike operations
with varied success.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was many years ere this particular
period of Uruguay's strenuous vicissitudes came to
an end. The year 1851 marked one of the numerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
dawns in the fortunes of the land. Then an alliance
was concluded between Uruguay and Brazil, while
the famous General Urquiza, revolting against the
Buenos Aires tyrant, brought the forces of Entre
Rios to join the league that was now formed against
Rosas. The result was the Battle of Monte Caseros,
in which the combined forces made an end to the
dictator's power, and caused him to flee to Europe.</p>

<p>The soil of Uruguay was once again free from
hostile troops. During the fleeting period of peace
that followed, it is necessary to take leave of two
of the three Orientales who had ridden to such
purpose on the breath of the whirlwind. A little
more than two years after the Battle of Monte
Caseras, Lavalleja died at Montevideo. In harness
to the end, the liberator of his country ended his
career just as he had once again been elected to
take a share in its government. Three short months
later Rivera followed his old comrade and enemy
to the land where the cavalry lance is unknown and
where no gunshot crashes echo.</p>

<p>With the Battle of Monte Caseros and the fall of
Rosas the range of episode enters comparatively
modern times. Although the war had ended successfully
for the Uruguayan cause, its conclusion left
the country in an utterly impoverished and desolate
condition. Through the terrible stress of events in
a land of such infinite natural resources the population
was roofless, and in many districts actually at the
point of starvation&mdash;an unheard of situation for such
a country. As for the treasury, it was virtually empty,
and the harassed Government found itself under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
necessity of seeking for loans from without its
frontiers on any terms that it could obtain.</p>

<p>On the 1st of March, 1852, Don Juan Francisco
Giro was elected as the fourth constitutional President
of Uruguay. The newly elected chief of the
State made desperate efforts towards ameliorating
the financial condition of the country, but political
complications were destined to work against success
from the very start. A fortnight after he had
assumed power the Uruguayan army that had borne
a brilliant share in the victory of Monte Caseros
returned home from Buenos Aires. Its commander,
General César Diaz, was acclaimed as a popular hero,
and was promptly created Minister for War and
Marine, although his sympathies were directly
opposed to the Government.</p>

<p>It was not long ere the antagonistic elements that
now surrounded him led to the resignation of Giro,
who in October delegated his authority to Don
Bernardo Berro. The latter, however, was able no
more than his predecessor to restrain the tide of
partizanship, and in July of 1853 an open revolution
broke out, headed by General Diaz and Colonel
Palleja. The outbreak occurred during a review
in the centre of Montevideo, and, dramatically conceived,
proved definitely successful within the course
of a few minutes. In the first instance Berro was
forced merely to appoint a fresh set of ministers,
whose views were hostile to his own; but very shortly
afterwards the President was obliged to vacate his
post in haste, and to take refuge in the French
legation.</p>

<p>At the end of September, 1853, a triumvirate
was formed of Generals Lavalleja, Rivera, and
Colonel Flores. The deaths of both the former
occurred ere the new regime could be adopted in
practice, and thus the survivor, Colonel Venancio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Flores, was elected to complete the term of the presidency
that Giro had vacated. He had scarcely taken
charge of the reins of government, however, when
his authority was rebelled against, this time by the
party who had lately been in power. Leaving
General César Diaz in charge of the Government,
Flores himself headed a successful campaign against
the revolutionists, at the end of which his military
rank was raised to that of General.</p>

<p>The unrest did not long remain quelled. Indeed,
so threatening did the situation become that Flores
appealed to the Brazilians for aid. In response the
northern republic sent an army of four thousand men,
who occupied the principal cities of Uruguay. The
result, as may be imagined, was a yet more marked
seething of discontent. In 1855, despite the presence
of the foreign troops, the Colorado, or red party,
now definitely formed, revolted, and by force of arms
obtained possession of the capital for a while.</p>

<p>The success of the revolutionists was short-lived.
General Oribe and many other members of the Blanco,
or white, group, came to the assistance of Flores. In
the end a compromise was effected. The revolutionists
retired; Flores resigned his post, and Don
Manuel Basilio Bustamente was elected as temporary
President. At this stage of Uruguayan history, however,
space does not permit a detailed description
of the various revolutions that followed the one upon
the heels of the other, and that were separated by
intervals of merely a few weeks or months.</p>

<p>An event of striking importance, however, occurred
in 1858, during the presidentship of Don Gabriel
A. Pereira. The latter had been opposed by General
César Diaz, who had stood as an unsuccessful candidate
for the office, and the inevitable jealousies soon
became embittered once more to the point of active
explosion. The policy of Diaz was now to incorporate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the Banda Oriental with the Argentine Provinces,
and thus to form a single country that should be
known as the United States of La Plata.</p>

<p>On the discovery of his plan Diaz was exiled to
Buenos Aires, and with him many of the more
prominent members of the Colorado party. Diaz,
however, soon made his way back across the river,
and, collecting an army of eight hundred men,
marched upon Montevideo, his forces swelling in
numbers as he went. Unsuccessful in its attempt
upon the capital, the revolutionist army retired, and,
after an indecisive battle or two, met with total defeat
at Cagancha. Diaz was taken prisoner in this action,
and was shot in company with fifty of his followers.</p>

<p>The remainder of Pereira's term of office passed in
comparative tranquillity. He was succeeded in 1860
by another representative of his own party, Don
Bernardo Berro, who was elected in constitutional
fashion. Three years later, however, General Flores
entered the arena of politics once more. The pretext
under which hostilities broke out was slight enough
in itself. A refusal on the part of the Government to
permit the celebration of the anniversary of the Battle
of Quinteros had enraged the Colorados, and Flores,
espousing their cause, led an army into the field. A
lengthy series of battles ensued, in the majority of
which Flores was successful. While the war was
still raging, Berro, having completed his term, was
succeeded as President by Don Atanasio Aguirre.
Flores, however, having now obtained the active
support of Brazil, was carrying all before him, and
in February of 1865 he entered Montevideo in
triumph, and was proclaimed provisional Governor
and then Dictator of the Republic.</p>

<p>In recapitulating the history of Uruguay at this
period the incessancy of the stream of warlike events
is amazing. Scarcely had Flores seated himself upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
what was virtually the throne of his dictatorship when
an event of international importance, the Paraguayan
war, occurred that was destined to convulse three
republics and an empire.</p>

<p>The pretext on which war was declared was the
armed intervention of Brazil in the affairs of the
Banda Oriental, and the support lent to Flores by
the Brazilian army&mdash;an interference that Francisco
Solano Lopez, the tyrannical Dictator of Paraguay,
took upon himself to resent hotly. Yet, even had not
this particular bone of contention come into being,
the war was undoubtedly inevitable. Paraguay's distrust
of Brazil, and the latter's dread of the really
formidable military forces that the inland republic
had gathered together, had piled up a situation that
only the faintest flame was required to set ablaze.</p>

<p>The military strength of Paraguay at this period
was considerable. With an army of eighty thousand
men of wild courage, backed by an adequate number
of cannon, she might well have bidden defiance to any
other single republic of South America. But her
strength was exceeded by her confidence. Desirous
of sweeping all before him, Lopez divided his forces,
and dispatched an army to the north in order to
invade Brazil, while another corps was told off to
strike in a south-easterly direction. In order to effect
this latter move it was necessary to obtain Argentina's
consent to cross her province of Corrientes. This
permission, which would have involved a breach of
neutrality, was, not unnaturally, refused. Incensed
at this check to his plans, Lopez declared war upon
Argentina, and occupied the province of Argentina by
force of arms. In the meanwhile Flores, in return
for the support he had received from Brazil, threw
in the lot of the Banda Oriental with that of the
northern empire.</p>

<p>Thus Paraguay found herself face to face with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the allied powers of Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay,
and a struggle ensued that cost the lives of tens of
thousands ere the death of Lopez ended the long
and desperate fight, at the conclusion of which Paraguay
stood all but bereft of her adult manhood.
Flores assumed command of the Uruguayan forces
that took part in the campaign, and the Oriental
division distinguished itself on numerous occasions
in the course of the arduous conflict.</p>

<p>Fifteen months after the beginning of the war
Flores found it necessary to return to Montevideo,
where, in spite of the foreign campaign, symptoms
of internal unrest had again become evident. Here
in 1868 he met with the fate that had passed him
by in the course of the Paraguayan war. Learning
that a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d'état</i> had suddenly come about, and
that a body of men had taken the Government House
by assault, Flores without delay started out in his
carriage to gain the scene of action. This move, as
a matter of fact, had been foreseen by the conspirators,
and a broken-down wagon blocked one
of the streets through which he had to pass. As
the General's carriage came to a halt in front of
the obstruction, a group of men rushed out from the
neighbouring doorways, and a minute later the body
of Flores, mortally wounded by gunshots and knives,
was left lying in the roadway.</p>

<p>This tragedy, however, was of little material assistance
to the Blanco party. Indeed, the sole result, so
far as they were concerned, was the execution of
one or two of their leaders. The power remained
with the party of the dead Flores, and General
Lorenzo Batlle was elected President, ruling with no
little determination despite the frequent revolutionary
movements that continued to occur. On various
occasions, it is true, the situation of the Government
became critical enough, and in 1870 the capital itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
was besieged by the insurrectionists; but in the
end Batlle prevailed, and the insurrectionists were
repulsed, at all events for the time being.</p>

<p>Beyond these warlike episodes much of importance
occurred during the rule of this President, which
lasted until 1872. Two distinct catastrophes marked
the years 1868 and 1869. The former was darkened
by a terrible visitation of cholera, while during the
latter a financial crisis arose that caused the ruin of
many thousands of Oriental families. Nevertheless,
the year 1869 is to be marked in white among the
milestones of Uruguay's progress; for it was then
that the railway was inaugurated, and a line completed
between Montevideo and Canelones that
marked the first falling into line of the Republic
with the more advanced countries.</p>

<p>The next President, Doctor José Ellauri, failed
to complete his term of office. In January of 1875
a military revolution forced him to take hasty refuge
in a Brazilian warship that was lying in the port
of Montevideo, while Don Pedro Varela was
acclaimed by the army as chief of state. Raised to
power at the point of the bayonet, Varela found it
necessary to sustain his post by the same force.
Although his armies succeeded in suppressing the
numerous popular risings, the dissatisfaction in the
end became so general and a condition of monetary
crisis so pronounced that Varela was forced to resign.</p>

<p>Colonel Latorre next assumed power as Dictator.
His handling of this dangerously powerful office was
liberal, and after three years of office he was elected
in 1879 as constitutional President of the Republic.
Almost immediately after this, however, the political
situation became too complicated for his patience, and
he vacated his post, declaring, it is said, that the
Uruguayans were ungovernable as a race. Doctor
Francisco Vidal, who succeeded him, was replaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in 1882 by General Santos. Although no marked
internal disturbances occurred during the presidentship
of this latter, the Blanco party were making
strenuous efforts just outside the frontiers of the
Republic to organise a revolutionary campaign on
a serious scale. In 1886, when his office was completed,
Santos caused Vidal to be elected once more,
meaning to succeed him again, as he had already
done on a previous occasion.</p>

<p>No sooner had Vidal occupied the presidential
chair than the threatened revolution broke out.
General Santos, at the head of the Government forces,
effectually suppressed the rising, whereupon Vidal
resigned in his favour. A governmental crisis
ensued; the Ministry resigned in a body, and Santos
was wounded in the course of an attempt upon his
life. Efforts towards the keeping of the national
peace were now made on both sides, and by means
of strenuous endeavour a mixed Ministry was formed.
Known by the title of "the Ministry of Conciliation,"
the new Government was acclaimed with enthusiastic
rejoicings throughout Uruguay. Shortly after its
formation Santos proceeded to Europe in order to
obtain a complete recovery from his wound, and
General Tajes was elected President of the Republic.</p>

<p>During Tajes's term of office and that of his
successor, Doctor Julio Herrera y Obes, matters
remained fairly quiet. In 1894 Don Juan Idiarte
Borda became chief of state by election, and three
years later a revolution on the part of the Blanco
party broke out afresh. At the end of six months'
fighting Borda was assassinated in the streets of
Montevideo, and the tragic event was followed by
the patching up of a temporary peace.</p>

<p>Don Juan Lindolfo Cuestas, who next assumed
control of the Government, was successful in bringing
about a treaty with the Blanco party, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
September of 1897 the revolutionists laid down their
arms. We now arrive at a period that is practically
that of the present day. In 1903 Don José Batlle
y Ordoñez was elected President. For the first year
of his rule he had to contend with further risings of
the Blanco party, in the course of which numerous
battles were fought. In the end the Government
forces were signally successful, and in September
of 1904 peace was signed and a general amnesty
declared.</p>

<p>In 1907 Doctor Claudio Williman succeeded Señor
Batlle. The first years of his tenure of office passed
in tranquillity; but at the end of 1910 the Blancos
became active once more, and various actions were
contested ere the Government troops once more
obtained the mastery of the situation in January
of 1911.</p>

<p>Having thus brought this rough sketch of
Uruguayan history to its conclusion at the present
day, it must be admitted that the trend revealed
throughout is distinctly warlike. Indeed, the battles
that have reddened the soil of the Banda Oriental
since its first colonisation are amazingly numerous.
I have compiled a list of some 120, and were minor
skirmishes included a volume would be needed to
contain the list. It is, indeed, the militant portion of
history that must necessarily stand out chiefly in
a cursory survey such as this. The progress of
industry, education, science, and art by the side of
the roar of strife is necessarily a silent one. Its
course has been none the less forceful for all that;
and universities, schools, national institutions of every
kind, port-works, and the general paraphernalia of
commerce testify to the fact that Uruguay has not
permitted her numerous internal struggles to divert
the nation from its true forward march. In at least
one sense the situation renders tribute to the virile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
qualities of the Uruguayan. For there are surely few
nations that can exhibit a battle-roll such as this,
and yet at the same time produce convincing evidence
of prosperity and progress. With a proper manipulation
of the great national energies, and their
devotion to the pursuits of peace alone&mdash;tendencies
that are becoming each year more marked&mdash;the
prospects of the Banda Oriental would excel even
the present fair promise of her future.</p>

<p>Life in Uruguay is perhaps best described by the
German word <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">gemüthlich</i>, an untranslatable adjective
that savours in its birthplace just a little of light
beer, easy-chairs, cigar smoke, steaming coffee, and
an atmosphere of <em>camaraderie</em>. After which it is
necessary to come to an abrupt halt in this task of
translation, since the danger of dragging in a foreign
word becomes evident when it is necessary to introduce
another in order to explain it. In any case, this good-fellowship
of the Uruguayan is of a far lighter order
than the Teutonic, and is only remotely concerned
with the material matters of life. Like the majority
of the races of Iberian descent, the Oriental is essentially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
sober in his tastes, and frequently of an
ascetic temperament. Such traits are inborn and
natural, and by no means the result of a campaign
of schooling and self-repression. He has not, for
instance, found it necessary to undergo an outward
treatment of badges and blue ribbons nor to devote
himself to a special era of self-protection from the
like of which the chastened Anglo-Saxon is only just
emerging.</p>

<p>For generations the Spanish Main has afforded
a lucrative field to the writers of pure sensationalism&mdash;if
the word be allowed. Their choice has undoubtedly
been a wise one, and a judicious compound
of fair creoles, satanic dons, swashbuckling pirates,
and heroes of the tenderest age has proved an almost
inexhaustible gold-mine of really lurid fiction. Yet
it cannot be said that this fervid literature has led
to a complete understanding of the South American
character by the British youth. As to the popular
and stirring villainies, I will not attempt to deny
that in the past deeds have been enacted that were
as terrible as those which have shuddered in print
between gaudy paper covers. There were many
beyond, infinitely worse, and altogether unthinkable.
But the perpetrators of these were seldom enough
of the stereotyped temperament as portrayed by the
blood-and-thunder authors. Alas for the double-dyed
deceit that lurked between the terrific drunken
orgies! The real chief organisers of such colossal
outrages as have obtained went about their business
with a directness that was worthy of a better cause,
and reddened the pages of history with a strictly
methodical and painstaking industry. Moreover, they
were as sober as an infant of eight at a Band of
Hope festival.</p>

<p>But all this has very little to do with the present-day
dwellers in Uruguay, and their habits and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
customs. The atmosphere of the country is essentially
one of civility. If you would learn the temperament
of a nation, mark the behaviour of its humbler
public functionaries! In fact, one of the first steps
that a student of national character should take is
merely to ask a policeman the first question that
enters the mind. In order to apply the severest test
the query should be a crassly foolish one. In France
may be expected vivacious expostulation, in Germany
an explosion of imperative military sounds, in Holland
a placid non-comprehension, in Portugal a pathetic
eagerness to satisfy at all costs&mdash;I have tried all
these, and more beyond than would stand inclusion
here without the risk of wearying. The Uruguayan
policeman, in his uniform of British pattern, is essentially
courteous, while the manners of the tram
conductors, railway guards, and those other genii of
transit in whose hands the fate of the traveller lies
are equally to be commended.</p>

<p>The absence of sycophancy that is characteristic
of nearly all South American Republics is especially
marked in Uruguay. A sturdy democracy is evident
here even amongst those whose menial service is
of the nature to evoke professional obsequiousness
in other parts of the world. The waiter, for instance,
will serve with brisk attention, but at the end of
the repast he will as often as not pocket the
customary tip as a matter of course that is unworthy
of comment, to say nothing of thanksgiving. At
the same time, it is certain that he would bear no
grudge against a well-acquainted patron who had
omitted the ceremony altogether. At a genuine
Uruguayan hotel the returning guest who has been
fortunate enough to win the esteem of the hall porter
will find his hand cordially grasped in greeting by
that official. The Banda Oriental is a country of
discrimination and individuality where personality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
counts and where popularity is a very material asset.
Such a land as this is undoubtedly a home of
opportunity.</p>

<p>The hospitality of the higher classes is proverbial.
Indeed, reputable conviviality of all kinds is at a
premium. In Montevideo the occasions for the giving
of banquets are numberless. Thus if a man has
achieved something in particular it is necessary that
a banquet should mark the event, if he has expressed
his intention of achieving anything in particular, a
banquet forms the appropriate prelude to the work,
and if he has failed to do anything in particular,
there is nothing like one of these selfsame banquets
to console him for the disappointment.</p>

<p>It is, in fact, much to the Uruguayan's credit that
he contrives to extract a vast deal of enjoyment
from life in a comparatively homely and unostentatious
manner. The race meetings here, for instance,
are most pleasant functions, although the horses are
not burdened with the responsibility of those
tremendous stakes that prevail in some other parts.
The theatres, too, although they obtain the services
of excellent companies, are moderate in their charges&mdash;moderate
considering the usual scale that prevails
in South America, that is to say.</p>

<p>The advent of a prosperity, however, that now
seems more definite than ever before has produced
a similar effect upon household expenditure as in
the neighbouring countries. The cost of living has
risen by leaps and bounds during the past two or
three years&mdash;a fact that salaried foreigners resident
in the country have found out to their somewhat
acute inconvenience. In the Campo, naturally
enough, this phenomenon of ways and means has
not occurred. When live stock and acres are
numbered only by the thousand such annoying
matters as house-rent and the butcher's bill fail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
carry any significance. Nevertheless, in Montevideo
the former has practically doubled itself within the
last half-dozen years, and all similar items have
followed suit as a matter of course. But the rise
in the price of land signifies prosperity, and is at
all events welcome enough to those directly interested
in the soil.</p>

<p>South America, taken as a whole, is a continent
whose inhabitants are not a little addicted to ostentation.
The phase is natural enough in view of the
conditions that obtain in so many of the Republics.
In the case of the pastoral countries, even in quite
modern times the broad lands had lain comparatively
valueless until the introduction of the freezing
process for meat and the opening up of the great
wheat and maize areas sent up the price of the
soil by leaps and bounds. Yet even prior to this
era a certain amount of prosperity had prevailed,
and young South Americans had become accustomed
up to a certain point to wend their way for educational
purposes to France and to England, and thus
to assimilate European ideas with those that prevailed
at the time in the republics of the south.</p>

<p>The sudden advent of overflowing wealth thus
found them to a great extent prepared to introduce
the most high-flown of modern ideas into the life
of their own country. No doubt the very consciousness
of these riches that, head for head, undoubtedly
far surpass that of the dwellers in the old continent,
caused the South Americans to fling aside the last
vestige of pastoral simplicity and to make the roots
of this great wealth of theirs bud out into residential
palaces and entertainments of a rather fabulous
order. Since they had shown clearly enough that
their material gains had surpassed those of Europe,
what more natural than that they should endeavour
to prove with equal conclusiveness their ability to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
outshine the continent of their ancestors in the
ornamentation and luxuries that follow automatically
in the footsteps of fortune! Surely the trait is
nothing beyond the proof of a healthy rivalry.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan is curiously free from all evidence
of this ostentation. The life he leads is well supplied
with comforts, but its tendency is simple. Thus,
although a very fair number of well-turned-out
carriages and motor-cars exist in Montevideo, they
are seldom to be seen parading to and fro in
imposing processions along an avenue or street
specially adapted for the purpose, as is the case
in many other cities. Rather less rigorous tenets,
moreover, obtain in the case of the costume of the
male city dwellers, and the whole atmosphere of
the country, in fact, is one of plain comfort that
has little concern with outward display. Uruguay,
for the present, at all events, has retained its
democracy. Whether it will continue to do so when
the national wealth has become more consolidated
is another matter.</p>

<p>The physique of the Uruguayan men is of a
distinctly high order. Well-set-up and fresh-complexioned,
they represent a favourable testimonial
to the climate of the country. In all equestrian
exercises they are, as may be imagined, past masters,
and they have proved themselves apt pupils at sports
and games of all kinds. As is general throughout
almost the length and breadth of South America,
football is much in vogue here, although, owing
merely to the scarcity of the population, the
ubiquitous game is less played in the country
districts than is the case in Argentina.</p>

<p>The art of bull-fighting still obtains in Uruguay,
notably at Colonia, on the banks of the river, where
a large new edifice has been erected for the benefit
of this, I think, regrettable sport. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Espadas</i> from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Spain frequently come out to perform here; but
with the exception of Colonia, that attracts the
tourist class from abroad, the haunts of bull-fighting
lead only a precarious existence in the Republic.</p>

<p>The Oriental is undoubtedly a man of deeds;
but in his case the tendency to action is not effected
at the expense of speech. He is, indeed, a born
orator, and on the slightest provocation will burst
forth into a stream of eloquence that can be quite
indefinitely continued. In any case, it is pleasant
enough to listen to the resounding periods in which
the customary lofty sentiments are couched, but it
is as well to bear in mind that the oratorical effort
may mean very much&mdash;or very little.</p>

<p>Uruguay, more especially its capital, is well-found
in the matter of femininity. Indeed, ever since it
became a full-blown city Montevideo has been celebrated
for its pretty women. This fortunate state
of affairs has now become a well-recognised fact, in
which the masculine portion of the community takes
an even greater pride than does the sex more
directly involved. Should a patriotic Montevidean
be engaged in conversation with an interested
foreigner, the chances are that it will not be long
ere the confident question is asked: "And our
señoritas, what is your opinion of them?"</p>

<p>In such a case there can be only one opinion&mdash;or
expression of opinion. Conscience may be salved
by the reflection that it is as difficult to find a woman
without some stray claim to beauty as it is to light
upon a dame of sixty without a grey hair. In both
cases the feature may be hard to see. If so, it
must be taken for granted. In the case of the
Montevidean señorita no such feat of the imagination
is necessary. To the far-famed graces of her
sisters throughout South America she adds the
freshness of complexion and the liveliness of
temperament that are characteristic of the land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, to conceive these lighter virtues, added
to the natural Spanish stateliness, is to picture a
very bewitching feminine consummation. Much has
been written concerning the señoritas of Uruguay,
and yet not a line too much. Their own kith and
kin have sung their praises with all the tremendous
hyperbole of which the Spanish tongue is capable.
White hands, bright eyes, raven hair, and a corresponding
remainder of features that resemble all
pleasant things from a dove to the moon&mdash;the
collection of local prose and verse on the subject
is justifiably enormous.</p>

<p>The Montevidean lady has now, of course, become
essentially modern. She rides in a motor-car, plays
the piano instead of the guitar, and has exchanged
the old order in general for the new. Yet the same
vivacity, courage, and good looks remain&mdash;which is
an excellent and beneficial thing for Montevideo and
its inhabitants. Indeed, the beach of Poçitos or
the sands of Ramirez shorn of their female adornment
would be too terrible a disaster to contemplate
even on the part of the most hardened Oriental.
And at this point it is advisable to forsake for the
present the more intimate affairs of the people,
leaving the last word to the ladies, as, indeed, is
only fitting&mdash;and frequently inevitable.</p>

<p>The majority of South American Republics&mdash;or
rather of those in the lower half of the continent&mdash;are
keenly alive to the benefits of many of the
European methods and institutions. Although each
of these countries possesses a strong individuality of
its own, the generality of these younger nations have
almost invariably shown themselves eager to graft
to their system foreign methods of organisation that
have stood the test of time and that have not been
found wanting.</p>

<p>Indeed, in matters of practical progress the citizen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of the more enlightened South American Republics
is blessed with an unusually open mind. This condition
has naturally borne fruit in experiments, and
it is this very tendency to receptiveness that has
frequently laid these States open to accusations of
irresponsibility. Often enough the charge has proved
entirely unjust, since it was based on nothing beyond
a too fervent outbreak into an experimental region
from which it was hoped to extract remedies and
innovations that should tend to the betterment of
the Republic.</p>

<p>The direction of the public services affords striking
instances of the kind. The navy, army, and police
of the more progressive of the republics are usually
modelled on European patterns. The navy is usually
conducted on the English system, the army follows
German methods, and the police copies as closely
as possible the time-honoured principles of what is
undoubtedly the finest force in the world, the English
constabulary. Uruguay follows this procedure only
in part. The kit of the troops here is of the French,
rather than the German, pattern; and although the
naval uniforms throughout the civilised world are
all more or less alike, that of the Uruguayan does
not resemble the British as closely as do some others,
notably that of the Chilian. The costume of the
Oriental police, however, helmet and all, is almost
exactly the counterpart of the British, although it
boasts the additional adornment of a sword and of
spats.</p>

<p>The work of the Uruguayan police, moreover, is
to be commended for a lack of officiousness and
fussy methods. They are little concerned with
larceny, and with the similar forms of petty dishonesty,
for the nation, as a whole, is endowed with
a strict sense of the sacredness of property. The
trait is to a large extent inherent in all the nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
of the River Plate; but in this instance it may well
be that it has become even more accentuated by
the drastic methods of General Artigas at the
beginning of the nineteenth century, whose abhorrence
of theft and whose exemplary castigation of
the crime may well have left an impression that
has endured for almost a century.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the sobriety of the
Uruguayan. Perhaps for the reason that he is of
a more openly jovial temperament he is slightly more
addicted to looking upon his native wine when it
is red than is the Argentine or Paraguayan. But
the cases where this occurs are isolated enough.
Indeed, in the matter of sobriety the Uruguayan
can easily allow points to almost every European
nation. The majority of crimes that occur to the
east of the River Plate are neither those brought
about by dishonesty nor drink. They are far more
frequently the result of differences of opinion and
of old-standing feuds that are avenged by the knife
and revolver, for the Uruguayan, though courteous
to a degree, is quick to resent offence, more especially
when the umbrage given is brought about in the
course of a political discussion.</p>

<p>At the time of the Spanish Conquest the territory
which now constitutes the Republic of Uruguay was
peopled by about four thousand Indians. These,
however, did not form a single nation, but were
divided off into a number of tribes. The most important
of these were the Charrúas, Yaros, Bohanes,
Chanas, and Guenoas. Each of these groups
possessed its own territory, and each was wont to
exist in a state of continued hostility with its neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing is known of the history of these folk
previous to the arrival of the Spaniard, and even
during the earlier periods of the conquest information
is scanty enough, since contact between native and
European was confined almost entirely to warlike
occasions, and since, even when opportunity offered,
the early colonists were neither sufficiently adapted
nor especially educated for the purpose.</p>

<p>The Charrúas constituted the leading tribe of these
aboriginal people. They owed this ascendancy to
their warlike spirit, and to their comparatively large
numbers. It was they who murdered Juan Diaz de
Solis, the discoverer of the Rio de la Plata, together
with many of his companions, and it was they, moreover,
who offered the most strenuous resistance to
the colonising attempts of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>The Charrúas, to the number of a couple of thousand,
inhabited the coast of the River Plate, and
carried on a semi-nomadic existence between
Maldonado and the mouth of the River Uruguay,
occupying a region that extended inland for about
ninety miles, its inner frontiers running parallel with
the coast-line. The stature of these natives attained
to middle height; they were robust, well built, and
usually free from that tendency to obesity which
is the characteristic of the Guarani Indians. As a
race they were distinguished by rather large heads,
wide mouths, and flat noses. Their skin was
unusually dark, and in colour approached the complexion
of the negro more nearly than that of any
other South American race. Peculiarly adapted to
resist hunger and fatigue, they were agile and swift
of foot as became those who existed principally on
the deer and ostriches that they hunted. It is said
that their health was such that many attained to a
very advanced age.</p>

<p>The character of these Indiana was essentially warlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and turbulent, and they were remarkable for their
passion for revenge and deceit. Of a taciturn and
apathetic temperament, they refused to submit to
discipline of any kind. They were, moreover,
peculiarly averse to outward display of any emotion.
A laugh, for instance, would be noiseless, signalled
merely by a half-opening of the lips; conversation
was carried on in a low and unmodulated tone of
voice, and a true Charrúa would run a considerable
distance to gain a comrade's side rather than be
under the necessity of shouting openly to him. The
sole occasions on which the exercise of patience
would seem to have come naturally to the race
were those of hunting and of scouting. A child of
nature, with the faculties of hearing and sight marvellously
developed, the Charrúa became reticent and
morose when brought into contact with civilisation.</p>

<p>In social ethics these dwellers on the coast ranked
low; indeed, their place was amongst the lowest in
the scale of tribes. Division either of labour or of
the spoils of war was unknown. Each hunted and
fought for his own hand alone, while the wife constructed
a few rude utensils and performed the duties
of a slave. Their system knew neither laws, punishments,
nor rewards, and the only services that were
wont to be recompensed in any way were those of
the medicine-men, whose natural cunning was doubtless
as superior to that of the rest as is the case elsewhere.
Nevertheless, these leeches seem to have
been acquainted with only one remedy. This was to
suck with might and main at that portion of the
body beneath the surface of which an inward pain
was complained of. The marriage ceremony was
confined to the obtaining of the consent of the bride's
parents. The state of wedlock, however, was considered
of some importance in the man, as it conferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
on him the right to go to war, and to take
part in the councils of the tribe.</p>

<p>Morality, as understood by the more advanced
sections of humanity, was at a low ebb. Wedlock
was permitted an unnaturally liberal range and
licence. Not only was polygamy general, but
marriages between brothers and sisters were permitted,
although it is related that their occurrence
was rather rare. Cases of monogamy, however, were
not unknown, and, whenever the opportunity offered,
a wife would desert a multi-spoused husband in order
to take up her abode with a man who was willing
to accept her as his only wife. Conjugal faithlessness
was held to be an excusable failing; indeed, on the
arrival of the Spaniards, the men would frequently
offer their wives to the Europeans in return for some
material advantage.</p>

<p>Some evidence of that social equality that is so
strongly a characteristic of the tribes of the River
Plate is to be met with among the Charrúas. Such
chiefs as existed were almost altogether lacking in
real power or authority. A leader, as a matter of fact,
was elected by the people merely in order to act in
cases of emergency, and his chieftainship, held on
sufferance, was liable to be taken from him on the
coming to the front of a man held more suitable for
the post. It is a little curious to find that in so fierce
a race private quarrels were not adjusted by means
of the crude arms of war that they possessed. These
disputes were fought out with the fists, and after a
satisfactory exchange of blows the matter was ended
for good and all.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this sensible method of settling
their individual differences, the Charrúas were
merciless in the wars waged against neighbouring
tribes or Spaniards. On the first outbreak of
hostilities they were wont to hide their women and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
children in the woods, after which spies were
immediately sent out to locate the position of the
enemy. This determined, it was usual to hold a
council of war in the evening, and to make a surprise
attack at the first glimmerings of dawn. The method
of their onslaught was one calculated to terrify.
Dashing out of the semi-obscurity, they would make
a furious charge, uttering loud cries, the fierceness of
which was supposed to be accentuated by means of
the warriors striking themselves continually on the
mouth.</p>

<p>Women and young children captured in their
attacks were taken back as prisoners to the rude
encampments of the conquerors, where they afterwards
received complete liberty, and became incorporated
with the tribe. No quarter, however, was
shown to the men of the beaten force. It is said
by some of the early European adventurers who came
into contact with this fierce race that they were not
only wont to scalp their fallen enemies, but that each
was accustomed to cut an incision in his own body
for every dead foeman whose body lay to the credit
of his prowess or cunning. Some doubt, nevertheless, is
thrown upon the existence of these habits, although they
are affirmed by three rather notable authorities, Barco,
Lozano, and Azara. Fortunately for the Spaniards,
who discovered in the Charrúas by far the most
dreaded enemies that it was their lot to encounter in
this part of South America, these Indians were easily
turned from a settled purpose or plan of campaign.
Thus they would lose many opportunities of pushing
home success, halting in an advance in order to
celebrate a first victory, and remaining on the ground
for the purpose of marking the occasion at length.</p>

<p>The fact that these rude savages should have
obtained victories over the Spaniards by means of
the crude arms that were known to them speaks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
wonders for their bravery. Their choice of warlike
implements was no whit greater than that enjoyed
by the lake-dwellers of the Stone Age. Arrows,
spears, clubs, and maces&mdash;all these were made up of
stone heads and wooden shafts. That which might
be termed the characteristic native weapon was the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bolas</i>, the pair of stone balls attached to ostrich
sinews or to some other contrivance of the kind.
These&mdash;as remains the case to the present day in other
lands&mdash;were employed as slings, and, for the purpose
of entangling an enemy, were the most dreaded
implements of all.</p>

<p>For the purposes of peace as well as for those of
war the sole materials available to the Charrúa for
the fashioning of implements were stone, wood, bone,
and clay. Thus the household equipment was wont
to be confined to the most primitive types of knives,
saws, punches, hammers, axes, mortars, pestles, and
roughly baked pottery. It is certain that they used
canoes, since they used to cross over to the islands
facing Maldonado, but nothing is known concerning
the particular build of these humble craft.</p>

<p>Waged under such circumstances existence knew
little glamour. Yet even here certain ceremonial
institutions obtained. The women, for example,
on attaining to adult age were accustomed to
tattoo three stripes upon their faces as a signal of
the fact, while the men wore a certain kind of headgear
to bear a similar significance. On the death
of a male, the warrior was buried with his arms,
usually on the summit of a small hill. Later, when
the luxury of domestic animals became known, the
rites grew more elaborate, and the dead man's horse
was usually sacrificed on the grave.</p>

<p>In any case the occasion of a man's death was
marked by self-mutilation on the part of his wives
and female relatives. These would commence by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
cutting their fingers, weeping bitterly all the while,
and afterwards would take the spear of their deceased
relative, and with it would prick themselves in various
parts of the body and more especially in the arms,
which were frequently pierced through and through.
Azara was privileged to witness a number of these
painful ceremonies, which must have been carried out
with conscientious zeal, since he remarks that of all
the adult women that he saw none was without
mutilated fingers and numerous scars on the body.</p>

<p>These methods of accentuating sorrow, however,
were light when compared with the tortures that
adult sons were wont to inflict upon themselves on
the loss of their father. It was their duty first of all
to hide themselves, fasting, in their huts for two days.
This effected, it was customary to point a number
of sticks and to transfix the arms with these from
the wrist to the shoulder, with an interval of not
more than an inch between each. In this porcupine-like
condition they proceeded either to a wood or to
a hill, bearing in their hands sharpened stakes. By
means of these each would dig out a hole in the earth
sufficiently deep to cover him to the height of the
breast, and in this custom demanded him to remain
during a whole night. On the next day the mourners
rose up from their uncomfortable holes, and met together
in a special hut that was set apart for the
ceremonial purposes. Here they pulled the sticks
from their arms, and remained for a fortnight,
partaking of only the scantiest nourishment. After
which they were at liberty to rejoin their comrades,
and to resume the comparatively even tenor of their
normal existence.</p>

<p>The Charrúas afford one of the rare instances of a
race who knew no religion. They neither worshipped
a benevolent divinity nor endeavoured to propitiate
a malignant spirit. They were, nevertheless, superstitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
up to a certain point, and dreaded to leave
their huts during the night. There is no doubt
that some vague belief in an after-existence must
have been implanted in their lowly minds. Although
they do not seem ever to have referred openly to the
belief, the sole fact of the burial of the dead man's
arms in the same grave as the corpse is sufficient
proof of their supposition that the weapons would
be needed in some half-imagined and dim place
beyond. But neither priest nor magician was in their
midst to stimulate their wonderings on the point.</p>

<p>The highest degree of science or intellect, as a
matter of fact, was represented by the medicine-men
with their simple and mistakenly practical remedy.
The race had no acquaintance with either music,
games, dancing, or with ordinary conversation as
understood amongst more civilised beings. In matters
of personal adornment the Charrúas were equally
unsophisticated. A few ostrich feathers in the hair
constituted the beginning and the end of the men's
costume; the sole garment of the women was a
loin-cloth. Of too dull a temperament to discover
even the simplest pleasures that the majority of races
contrive to extract from their existence, the sole
luxury in which these folk indulged was the bathing
in the streams of the country. But this recreation
was limited to the midsummer months: during all
the other periods of the year they refrained entirely
from ablutions.</p>

<p>The point as to whether these benighted Indians
were cannibals has never been definitely cleared up.
The charge of eating human flesh has been brought
against the tribe by a certain number of authorities.
It is stated, for instance, that the body of Juan
Diaz de Solis, the discoverer of the River Plate and
one of the first victims of these warriors, was consumed
by the attacking party after his murder. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the evidence is not clear in either this case or in any
other of the kind, although it is likely enough that
they partook of the taste that was shared by various
tribes who inhabited the country to the north. Their
ordinary food, in any case, was the flesh of the deer
and ostrich, as well as fish. Their meals were
frequently demolished in a raw condition, doubtless of
necessity, although they understood the means of producing
fire by the friction of wood. Vegetable food
was unknown to them, but they contrived to produce
an intoxicating liquor from the fermentation of
wasps' honey mixed with water.</p>

<p>A glance at the more intimate domestic life of these
wild possessors of so many strictly negative attributes
may well complete a rather desolate picture. The
home of the Charrúa was on a par with the remainder
of his few belongings. A few branches, stuck into the
earth and bent towards a common centre, constituted
the foundation; one or two deer-skins placed on top
of these formed the superstructure. These dwellings,
as a matter of fact, were no more crude than those
of the Patagonian natives, and little more so than
the huts of the Chaco Indians to the north-west,
although the structures of both these latter were&mdash;and
still remain&mdash;thatched with grasses and vegetation in
the place of skins. In the case of the Charrúa the
inner accommodation was limited to a few square
feet; but the confined space sufficed to hold an
ordinary member, although if the human units increased
unduly, a second hut was erected by the
side of the first. For furniture, there were the few
crude household implements already mentioned, the
weapons of the men, and the deer-skin or two spread
upon the ground to serve as couches.</p>

<p>It was in this manner that the Charrúas were
accustomed to live when the Spaniards, much to
the rage of the original inhabitants, landed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
their shores. From that time onwards their method
of existence underwent a change. With the introduction
of horses they adopted the habit of riding,
and soon became extraordinarily proficient in all
equestrian arts, although their natural fleetness of
foot suffered inevitably during the process. The
cattle that now roamed the Campo in great numbers
afforded them ample and easily obtained meals.
Indeed, although they may have had some legitimate
cause for grievance, the material benefits that the
influx from Europe accorded the Indians were
enormous.</p>

<p>Yet the hatred with which these fierce warriors of
the Campo regarded the white intruders tended with
time to increase rather than diminish. As a foe the
Indian was far more formidable now than at the time
of the first encounters. Behold him on horseback,
careering like the wind across the pastures, armed
with a deadly iron-tipped lance some fourteen feet
in length! For he had obtained the means now to
fight the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">conquistadores</i> with their own weapons, and
even his arrows were pointed with metal, although
he still retained the homely stone in the case of his
ever efficient <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bolas</i>. Thus he remained, immutably
fierce, alternately winning and losing the endless
fights, but never conquered nor enslaved for three
centuries. At the end of that period, in 1832, came
the end of his race, and the small remnant was
practically annihilated. The fate of the last four
of the Charrúas is pathetically humorous, as illustrating
what unsuspected ends a wild community may
be made to serve. Two men and two women, the
sole survivors of the unconquered warrior tribe, were
sent across the ocean to Paris, where they were
placed on exhibition, and doubtless proved a profitable
investment.</p>

<p>Having concluded with the Charrúas, the remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
aboriginal tribes of Uruguay demand very little
space by comparison. There were, nevertheless, half
a dozen minor groups that inhabited the other portion
of the land that is now Uruguay.</p>

<p>The Yaros Indians occupied a small district on the
south-western coast of the country, and were a warlike
race whose customs and manner of existence
much resembled those of the Charrúas. With this
latter race they were on terms of hostility, and only
allied themselves with their aboriginal neighbours for
the occasional purpose of a joint attack upon the
Spaniards. At the beginning of the eighteenth
century they were to all intents and purposes exterminated
by the more powerful Charrúas, the few
survivors joining the ranks of their conquerors.</p>

<p>Little is known of the Bohanes, who occupied the
coastal territory to the north of the Yaros. They
were likewise enemies of the Charrúas, and in the
end suffered partial extermination at the hands of
the latter tribe. It is said that a certain number
escaped into Paraguay and became absorbed amongst
the Guarani inhabitants of the north. It appears
certain that, although this insignificant group could
not number much more than a hundred families, their
language differed entirely from the tongues of the
neighbouring tribes.</p>

<p>The Chanas were island-dwellers whose character
contrasted rather remarkably with that of the inhabitants
of the mainland. When first met with they were
occupying the islands in the River Uruguay to the
north of the point where the Rio Negro joins the
principal stream. A race of peaceable and rather timid
folk, they suffered not a little at the hands of the
more warlike tribes. Thus, when the Spaniards
occupied their native islands, the Yaros endeavoured
to obtain a footing on the western coast-line; but,
driven from here by the Charrúas, they found shelter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in a collection of islets to the south of those that
had formed their first abode. They were more or
less expert fishers and watermen, and possessed a
language of their own. Many of their customs were
akin to those of the Guarani Indians. Thus when
the bodies of their dead had been buried for a
sufficiently long time to lose all flesh, the skeletons
would be dug up, painted with grease and ochre, and
then entered once again in company with their
ancestors. In the case of a dead child it was their
custom to place the body in a large earthenware urn
which they filled with earth and ochre, covering up
the vessel with burnt clay.</p>

<p>The Chanas lent themselves readily to civilisation.
Towards the middle of the seventeenth century they
became converted to Christianity, and in the beginning
the Jesuit mission station of Soriano was
peopled almost entirely by members of this tribe.
Of an intelligence and temperament infinitely superior
to that of the remaining tribes, they mingled freely
with the Spaniards after a while, and adopted
European manners and customs. The race disappeared
eventually merely from the force of absorption
by marriage with their civilised neighbours.</p>

<p>The Guenoas existed in the north-western portion
of the country, leading a semi-nomadic life. They
were to be distinguished from the Indians who dwelt
to the south of their territory in that they were amenable
to discipline in their natural state. At their
head were recognised chiefs, or caciques, who appear
to have exercised no little authority. They were
endowed, moreover, with a certain amount of superstitious
belief, and witch-doctors were to be found
among them. They had also learned the art of
signalling from a distance by means of bonfires.
Although a warlike race, they were far more susceptible
than the Charrúas to outside influence. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
portion of the tribe eventually found refuge in the
Jesuit missions, and the majority of the males took
service in the Spanish and Portuguese armies.</p>

<p>The Minuanes occupied a territory to the east of
the Guenoas, and in physical appearance, manners,
and customs closely resembled the Charrúas, to such
an extent, indeed, that the two tribes have frequently
been confused by writers. An error of the kind is
natural enough, since the two groups were wont to
bind themselves in hard-and-fast alliance in order
to combat the Spaniards. The Minuanes, however,
were a trifle more advanced in some respects than
their southern allies. They were accustomed, for
instance, to wear loin-cloths, with the frequent addition
of a skin flung across the shoulders. Moreover, their
hostility towards Europeans was undoubtedly less
deep-seated, since the Jesuits succeeded in incorporating
them for a while in one of their missions. The
majority, it is true, soon returned to their own wild
life, but a certain number remained.</p>

<p>The last tribe to be noticed is that of the
Arachanes, a people of Guarani origin who lived
on the east coast between the ocean and the great
Lake Merim. Practically nothing is known of these
folk. They were dispersed and exterminated at the
commencement of the seventeenth century by the
Brazilian mamelukes in the course of their raids from
San Paulo.</p>

<p>It may come as a surprise to many to learn that
Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, possesses a
population of almost four hundred thousand inhabitants.
By no means one of those centres that
are remarkable only for population, it holds almost
every conceivable attribute of a modern city&mdash;from
boulevards and imposing public buildings to plazas,
statuary, and a remarkably extensive tramway
service.</p>

<p>Montevideo is situated at a peculiarly advantageous
point on the Uruguayan shore. No student
of geography, it is true, could point out the exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
limits of so immense a stream as the La Plata.
Yet for all practical purposes the capital of the
Republic sits just beside this very phenomenon.
Thus it may be said that the eastern side of the
town faces the ocean, while the southern looks upon
the River Plate. To enter more fully into the
geographical details of the spot, the chief commercial
and governmental districts cover a peninsula that
juts well out into the waters, thus forming the
eastern extremity of the semicircular bay of the
actual port. Upon the ocean side of the peninsula
the shore recedes abruptly northwards for a short
space, and it is here that lie the pleasant inlets that
are not a little famed as pleasure resorts.</p>

<p>At the riverward extremity of the port bay is
a landmark that is indelibly associated with Montevideo,
whether viewed from sea or land. The famous
Cerro is a conical hill, surmounted by a fort that
dominates all the surrounding landscape. But of
the Cerro, since for various reasons it is a place
of importance, more later. The capital itself claims
the right to prior notice, and to the rendering
of a few introductory facts.</p>

<p>Since the distance between the chief town of either
republic only just exceeds a hundred miles, a comparison
between Montevideo and Buenos Aires is
almost inevitable. Indeed, it has become something
of a hobby on the part of the Oriental who has
visited the Argentine city, and vice versâ. Fortunately,
the comparison can be made without the
engendering of bad blood, since to a great extent
that which the one town lacks is possessed by the
other. Thus, in the first place Montevideo, although
astonishingly thriving, is without the hastening
crowds and feverish hustle of the city across the
waters. Again, although its sheltered bay is yearly
accommodating more and larger vessels, the Oriental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
town is innocent of those many miles of docks teeming
throughout with steamers. Yet, on the other hand,
it possesses its rocks and shining sands of pleasure
that draw the Argentines themselves in shoals across
the river.</p>

<p>Indeed, the atmosphere of Montevideo is restful,
and at the same time free from the slightest taint
of stagnation. Even the more modest thoroughfares
are comparatively broad, while the many new avenues
are spacious and well planned to a degree. Perhaps
the keynote to the town in these respects may be
found in the fact that, although the absolute dominion
of the priests has long been a thing of the past, the
sound of the cathedral and church bells is audible
above the hum of the traffic. Even in the ears of
the most ardent Protestant the effect is not without
its soothing and tranquillising properties.</p>

<p>It is true that there have been some who, deceived
by its peaceful appearance, have altogether underrated
the actual activity of the city. As a matter
of fact, the progress of Montevideo deserves far wider
recognition than it has obtained. The town represents
something of a babe even amongst the roll
of comparatively youthful South American cities. Its
foundation, in 1726, indeed, was due to an afterthought,
following an expulsion of Portuguese who
had landed at the solitary spot and fortified it in
the course of one of their later expeditions. Thus
Colonia had long afforded a bone of contention
between the two nations, and even Maldonado had
provided several battlefields ere the present capital
was colonised or thought of.</p>

<p>In 1727 the panorama of Montevideo could not
well have been an imposing one. At that time the
place possessed no more than two buildings of stone,
although it could count forty others of hide. But
the erections of this homely and odorous material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
that in the colonial days were made to serve almost
every conceivable purpose could have added very
little to the æsthetic properties of the budding settlement.
Once established, however, the city grew
apace, and in due course the natural advantages of
its position raised its status to that of the premier
urban centre of the land.</p>

<p>But, although Montevideo flourished and increased
for rather more than a century and a half, its leap
into complete modernism has only been effected
within the last thirty years. In this respect it has
only followed the example of the important cities
of the neighbouring republics. Thus, in 1807, when
its ninetieth birthday was marked by the British
occupation, the accounts of numerous foreign visitors
to the place testify to its primitive state, although
all agree that in the main the capital was a pleasant
spot.</p>

<p>That the streets of the period were badly paved
it is not surprising to hear, since, owing to many
obstacles, the art of accurate paving is one of the
very last that has filtered through to South America
in general. On the other hand, it is admitted that
the thoroughfares were well lit. Amongst the more
disagreeable peculiarities were some for which the
butcher's trade was responsible.</p>

<p>In a country of oxen the superabundance of meat
was made only too evident. "Oftentimes," says an
English chronicler of the period, "when a particular
piece of meat is wanted, the animal is killed, and
after cutting out the desired part, without taking
off the skin, the remainder of the carcass is thrown
to the dogs, or left to rot in the streets." After
this the author proceeds to make a startling statement:
"Almost every animal is fed on beef: from
this circumstance pork and poultry bought casually
in the market, and which has not been purposely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
fattened, are tinctured with a very ancient and beef-like
taste." The first part of this piece of information
is undoubtedly accurate; but to what extent
the latter is the result of imagination or of fact
it is perhaps best not to investigate too closely.
According to this theory, some of the plainest of
joints must have contained in themselves the elements
of several courses, with a species of menagerie meal
as a consequence!</p>

<p>In any case, it is well known that the effect of
this abundant meat diet upon the prowling dogs of
the town was to render them savage and dangerous
to the casual passer-by, who frequently had to
defend himself as best he might from their attacks.
The extraordinary prevalence of rats from similar
causes is confirmed by other authors, Uruguayan as
well as English. The brothers Robertson, who are
responsible for such an excellent description of
Paraguay at that period, have some curious experiences
to relate concerning this visitation. Both
received much hospitality at the hands of their
Uruguayan friends. "The only drawback," writes
one of them, "upon the delightful way in which
I now spent my evenings was the necessity of returning
home through long, narrow streets so infested
with voracious rats as to make it perilous sometimes
to face them. There was no police in the town,
excepted that provided by the showers of rain, which,
at intervals, carried off the heaps of filth from the
streets. Around the offal of carrion, vegetables, and
stale fruit which in large masses accumulated
there, the rats absolutely mustered in legions.
If I attempted to pass near these formidable
banditti, or to interrupt their meals and orgies,
they gnashed their teeth upon me like so many
evening [ravening?] wolves ... sometimes I
fought my way straight home with my stick;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
at others I was forced to fly down some cross and
narrow path or street, leaving the rats undisturbed
masters of the field."</p>

<p>No doubt had a militant vegetarian of the period
found his way to Montevideo he might have pointed
out many object-lessons in favour of a lesser carnal
devotion. On the other hand, it is lamentable that
the cheap value at which carcasses were then held
has not continued to prevail to this day. To the
small population of a hundred years ago meat
seemed to grow as easily as grass-blades, and the
uses to which it was wont to be put seem astonishing
enough in an era of butchers' bills and shilling steaks.</p>

<p>Since until comparatively recent years in the River
Plate Provinces mutton has been held unworthy of
even a beggar's acceptance, the carcasses of the sheep
suffered the most ignominious end of all. Amongst
the other means they were made to serve, the animals
were driven to the brick-kilns, slaughtered upon the
spot, and their bodies flung into the ovens to feed
the fires. As for the cattle, their skulls and horns
were everywhere. Prepared by the foregoing for
revelations of general utility, it is not surprising
to read that houses as well as fence-lines were
frequently constructed from such tragic material.</p>

<p>Such reminiscences of the past, however, have
drawn the trail too far aside from the modern city
of Montevideo, where dogs are subject to police
regulations, and the rat is scarce, and meat as dear
as elsewhere. As for the town itself, it has sprung
up afresh, and renewed itself yet once again since
the colonial days. Indeed, the sole buildings of
importance that remain from the time of the Spanish
dominion are the cathedral and Government palace.</p>

<p>The national museum at Montevideo is both well
represented and amply stocked. It is a place into
which the average foreigner enters with sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
rarity, which is rather lamentable, since a very varied
local education is to be derived from its contents.
Uruguayan art, natural history, geology, literature,
and historical objects all find a place here. The
collection of primitive Indian utensils, and of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bolas</i>,
the round stones of the slings, is unique. It is
said that in the case of the latter, which have been
brought together from all districts, almost every
species of stone that exists in the country is to
be met.</p>

<p>The historical objects here, moreover, are of great
interest to one who has followed the fluctuating
fortunes of the country. The early uniforms and
weapons of the Spaniards, the costumes and long
lances of the first struggling national forces, and a
host of other exhibits of the kind are assisted by
a considerable collection of contemporary local
pictures and drawings. Many of the earlier
specimens of these are exceedingly crude, but none
the less valuable for that, since the battle scenes
are depicted with much the same rough vigour that
doubtless characterised their actual raging.</p>

<p>In the gallery devoted to Uruguayan painters there
is at least one picture that is remarkable for its
power and realism, the work of a famous modern
artist, representing a scene in the great plague
visitation that the capital suffered. It is a little
curious that in the rooms where hang the specimens
of European art the biblical paintings of some of
the old Italian masters should be hung side by side
with modern productions of the lightest and most
Gallic tendency; but it is quite possible that this
may have been done with intention in support of the
propaganda against the influence of Church and
religion that has now become so marked throughout
South America. In any case, the custom is one that
does not obtain in Montevideo alone. The taxidermic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
portion of the museum is exceedingly well
contrived, and the entire institution, with its competent
staff, under the direction of Professor José
Arechavaleta, is worthy of all praise.</p>

<p>With social institutions of all kinds Montevideo is
amply provided. The theatres are well constructed,
well patronised, and frequently visited by some of
the most efficient companies in existence. It is true
that, owing to the difference in the size of the two
towns, Montevideo usually obtains the tail-end of
a visit the most part of which has been spent in
Buenos Aires. But such matters of precedence do
not in the least affect the merits of the various performances.
Both actors and musicians here, moreover,
have to deal with an audience that is at least
as critical as any that its larger neighbour can
provide.</p>

<p>One of the evidences of Montevideo's modernity
is to be found in its afternoon-tea establishments.
Unfortunately, the name of the principal one of these
places has escaped me, so that it must receive its
meed of praise in an anonymous fashion. It is
certainly one of the daintiest specimens of its kind
that can be conceived both as regards decoration
and the objects of light sustenance that justify its
existence. As a teashop it is a jewel with an appropriate
pendant&mdash;a tiny coal-black negro boy official
at the door, whose gorgeous full-dress porter's
uniform renders him a much-admired toy of
humanity.</p>

<p>The chief and most imposing of the capital's clubs
is the Club Uruguay that looks out upon the Plaza
Matriz, the main square. The premises here are
spacious and imposing, and the club is quite of the
first order. The membership is confined almost
entirely to the Uruguayans of the better classes,
although it includes a small number of resident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
foreigners. The English Club is situated on the
opposite side of the same square, and is an extremely
cosy and well-managed institution that sustains to
the full all the traditions of the English clubs abroad.</p>

<p>The English community in the capital is fairly
numerous, and is in closer touch with its Uruguayan
neighbours than is the case with the majority of
such bodies in other South American countries. The
enterprise and philanthropy of the colony are evident
in many directions. It has long possessed a school
and a hospital of its own; but subscriptions have
now been raised for the erection of a larger and more
modern hospital building, to be situated in pleasant
surroundings on the outskirts of the town. A great
part of the credit for this, as for many other similar
undertakings, is undoubtedly due to Mr. R.J.
Kennedy, the British Minister.</p>

<p>The English Colony is represented journalistically
by a daily paper, the <cite>Montevideo Times</cite>, a sheet
of comparatively modest dimensions that is very ably
edited and conducted. Indeed, the record of Mr.
W.H. Denstone, the editor, must be almost unique
in the history of journalism all the world over. For
a period that, I believe, exceeds twenty years the
production, in journalese language, has been "put
to bed" beneath his personal supervision, and not
a number has appeared the matter of which has
not come directly from his hands. As a testimony,
not only to industry but to a climate that permits
such an unbroken spell of labour, surely the feat
is one to be cordially acclaimed in Fleet Street!</p>

<p>The Montevideo hotels, although there is much
to be said in their favour, are comparatively modest
in size, and somewhat lacking in those most modern
attributes that characterise many in other large towns
of South America, and even those in the pleasure
resorts on the outskirts of the Uruguayan capital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
itself. The best known is the Lanata, situated in
the Plaza Matriz. But I cannot recommend the
Lanata with any genuine degree of enthusiasm. The
Palacio Florida, a new hotel in the Calle Florida,
is, I think, the most confidently to be recommended
of any in the capital. The tariff here is strictly
moderate, the service good, and the place is blessed
with the distinct advantage of a very pleasant lounge
on each floor.</p>

<p>In many respects Montevideo, although its scale
of expenses is rising rapidly, still remains a place
of cheaper existence than Buenos Aires. But not
in the matter of its cabs and public vehicles. The
hooded victoria of the Argentine capital is frequently
replaced here by the landau, and on a provocation
that may not have exceeded half a mile the piratical
driver will endeavour to extract a dollar&mdash;the equivalent
of four shillings and twopence&mdash;from his
victimised passenger. The reason for this ambitious
scale of charges no doubt lies in the fact that the
Montevidean is very little addicted to driving in cabs,
of which vehicles, indeed, the very excellent tramway
service of the city renders him more or less
independent. Thus, as the solvent person is said
to bear the burden of the tailor's bad debts, the
economies of those who ride in Montevidean tramcars
are visited upon the pockets of those others
who patronise the cabs.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan's appreciation of pleasant Nature is
made abundantly clear in the surroundings of the
capital. The city, as a matter of fact, is set about
with quite an exceptional number of pleasant resorts
both inland and upon the shore. Of the former the
Prado park and the pleasure suburb of Colón are
the best known. The Prado is reached within half
an hour from the centre of the city by means of
tramway-car. Situated on the outskirts of the town,
the park is very large and genuinely beautiful.
Groves of trees shading grassy slopes, beds of flowers
glowing by the sides of ponds and small lakes, walks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
drives, and sheltered seats&mdash;the place possesses all
these commendable attributes, and many beyond.</p>

<p>The Montevidean is very proud of the Prado, and
he has sufficient reason for his pride. He has taken
a portion of the rolling country, and has made of
the mounds and hills the fairest garden imaginable.
The place would be remarkable if for nothing more
than the great variety and number of its trees, both
Northern and subtropical. But here this fine collection
forms merely the background for the less lofty
palms, bamboos, and all the host of the quainter
growths, to say nothing of the flowering shrubs and
the land and water blossoms. One may roam for
miles in and out of the Prado vegetation, only to
find that it continues to present fresh aspects and
beauties all the while.</p>

<p>The expedition to Colón is a slightly more serious
one, since, the spot being situated some eight miles
from the centre of the town, the journey by tramcar
occupies an hour or so. As much that is typical of
the outskirts of Montevideo is revealed by the excursion,
it may be as well to describe it with some
detail.</p>

<p>It is only when once fairly launched upon a journey
of the kind that the true extent of Montevideo and
the length of its plane-shaded avenues proper become
evident. Nevertheless, as the car mounts and dips
with the undulation of the land, the unbroken streets
of houses come to an end at length, giving way to
the first <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">quintas</i>&mdash;the villas set within their own
grounds. The aspect of these alone would suffice to
convince the passing stranger of the real wealth of
the capital. Of all styles of architecture, from that
of the bungalow to the more intricate structure of
many pinnacles and eaves, many of them are
extremely imposing in size and luxurious to a degree.
A moral to the new-comer in Montevideo should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
certainly be: Own a quinta in the suburbs; or, if
you cannot, get to know the owner of a quinta in
the suburbs, and stay with him!</p>

<p>But if you would see these surroundings of Montevideo
at their very best, it is necessary to journey
there in October&mdash;the October of the Southern hemisphere,
when the sap of the plants is rising to
counterbalance its fall in the North. The quintas
then are positive haunts of delight&mdash;nothing less.
Their frontiers are frequently marked by blossoming
may, honeysuckle, and rose-hedges, while bougainvillæa,
wistaria, and countless other creepers blaze
from the walls of the houses themselves.</p>

<p>As for the gardens, they have overflowed into an
ordered riot of flower. The most favoured nooks
of Madeira, the <em>Midi</em> of France, and Portugal would
find it hard to hold their own in the matter of
blossoms with this far Southern land. Undoubtedly,
one of the most fascinating features here is the
mingling of the hardy and homely plants with the
exotic. Thus great banks of sweet-scented stock will
spread themselves beneath the broad-leaved palms,
while the bamboo spears will prick up lightly by the
ivy-covered trunk of a Northern tree&mdash;a tree whose
parasite is to be marked and cherished, for ivy is,
in general, as rare in South America as holly, to
say nothing of plum-pudding, though it is abundant
here. Spreading bushes of lilac mingle their scent
with the magnolia, orange, myrtle, and mimosa, until
the crowded air seems almost to throb beneath the
simultaneous weight of the odours. Then down upon
the ground, again, are periwinkles, pansies, and marigolds,
rubbing petals with arum-lilies, carnations,
hedges of pink geranium, clumps of tree-marguerites,
and wide borders of cineraria. From time to time
the suggestions of the North are strangely compelling.
Thus, when the heavy flower-cones of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
horse-chestnut stand out boldly next to the snow-white
circles of the elder-tree, with a grove of oaks
as a background, it is with something akin to a
shock that the succeeding clumps of paraiso and
eucalyptus-trees, and the fleshy leaves of the aloe
and prickly-pear bring the traveller back to reality
and the land of warm sunshine.</p>

<p>But it is time to make an end to this long list of
mere growths and blossoms. The others must be
left to the imagination, from the green fig-bulbs to
the peach-blossom and guelder-roses. Let it suffice
to say that a number of these gardens are many acres
in extent, and that you may distribute all these
flowers&mdash;and the far larger number that remain
unchronicled&mdash;in any order that you will.</p>

<p>As the open country appears in the wider gaps
left between the remoter quintas, and the space
between the halting-places of the tram is correspondingly
lengthened, the speed of a car becomes
accelerated to a marked degree. The cottages that
now appear at intervals at the side of the road are
trim and spotlessly white. They are, almost without
exception, shaded by the native ombú-tree, and are
surrounded with trelliswork of vines and with fig-trees,
while near by are fields of broad beans and the
extensive vineyards of commerce.</p>

<p>Along the road a rider is proceeding leisurely, a
large wooden pannier jutting out from either side of
his saddle. This bulky gear, that lends such a
swollen appearance to the advancing combination of
man and horse, denotes a travelling merchant of
humble status. What he carries within the pair of
boxes there is no outward evidence to tell. Their
contents may be anything from vegetables or chickens
to scissors, knives, or sweetstuffs. Since, however,
he has now drawn rein by the side of one of the
white cottages, his wares almost certainly do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
comprise the first two, for the market for such lies
within Montevideo proper. By the time, however,
that the lids of the panniers have been raised and
the bargaining has commenced the car has sped
far onwards, and has dropped him from sight. Thus
the business of the travelling merchant&mdash;like that of
the majority of passers-by&mdash;remains but half understood.</p>

<p>But here, at all events, comes a group of riders of
another kind, whose purpose is clear. Half a dozen
small boys and bareheaded girls, mounted upon disproportionately
tall ponies, are jogging along on
their way to school. Uruguay prides itself, with
no little reason, upon the efficiency of its system of
education, and the humblest hut now sends forth
its human mites to absorb the three R's and to be
instilled with patriotically optimistic versions of their
country's past. These rudiments mastered, they need
not necessarily halt in their scholastic career, since,
according to the laws of the land, a professorship
is open eventually to the most lowly student who persists
for sufficient time. And Uruguay is undoubtedly
a nest of opportunities. An embryo statesman or
learned doctor may be represented by each of the
urchins who are now plodding onwards with serious
intent through the dust!</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the car has won its way fairly
out into the open country, always green, smiling,
and thickly shot with the pink of peach-blossoms.
The rails have now drawn well away from the centre
of the road, and are separated from the actual highway
by a grassy space. Stirred by the importance
of possessing a track all to itself, the car is undoubtedly
aspiring to the rank of a railway train,
and goes rushing at a really formidable pace upon
its verdure-embedded lines. Swaying over the
shoulders of the land, past plantations, lanes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
hedges, it plunges onwards in grim earnest to the
terminus of the line at Colón itself.</p>

<p>The actual village of Colón gives little indication
of the nature of the district. The railway-station,
shops, and houses are all pleasantly situated, it is
true, and the restaurants and pleasure-gardens are
unusually numerous. The attractions of the place,
however, lie well outside the central nucleus of
buildings. From this some remarkably imposing
eucalyptus avenues lead outwards into the favourite
haunts of the Montevidean when on pleasure bent.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the most salient feature of Colón is
the eucalyptus. Indeed, the place primarily consists
of mile upon mile of these stately avenues, fringed
by blue gums of an immense size. Bordering these
magnificent highways, that cross each other at right
angles, are country houses here and there that are
reproductions of those in the suburbs of Montevideo.
In between the avenues, again, are clumps and small
forests of eucalyptus, whose tops soar high up in
tremendously lofty waves, that enclose vineyards,
peach-orchards, and olive-tree plantations.</p>

<p>Here and there are lanes walled in by mounting
hedges of honeysuckle and rose, while many of the
private grounds are guarded by the impassable lines
of aloe. Add to this basis all the other trees, shrubs,
and flowers that have already been passed on the
outward journey, and you have the main attributes of
Colón.</p>

</div>

<p>Since the topic of the inner man appeals at least
as much to the Uruguayan as to any other mortal,
there are some very pleasant restaurants set in the
midst of this land of eucalyptus. Perhaps the best
and prettiest of these is one known by the very
English name of the Tea Garden Restaurant. One
of the chief peculiarities of the place is that tea is
actually partaken of there from time to time, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
modern Oriental is beginning to accord this cosmopolitan
beverage a recognised place by the side of
coffee and his own native Yerba Maté.</p>

<p>At the Tea Garden Restaurant it is possible to
lunch by the side of a lake, with ripening grape-bunches
above to throw their reflections in the soup,
and with the falling petals of orange-blossom floating
daintily past the steaming cutlets, while the music
of the ducks blends admirably with the clatter of the
table weapons. With really good cooking and attentive
service added to these side attractions, what
more could one want!</p>

<p>But the proprietors of the restaurant are nothing
if not enterprising. They give the wayfarer something
even beyond an excellent meal. At the end of
the repast each guest is presented with a ticket that
entitles him to a free cab-ride to the tramway terminus.
The idea is admirable. Nothing is wanting
but the cabs! At all events, when I had concluded
lunch there the surface of the fine avenue was
innocent of any vehicle, and continued so until the
walk to the car was accomplished. But the courtesy
of the offer had been effectual, and a certain sense
of obligation remained.</p>

<p>The bathing-places of Poçitos and Ramirez are
akin in many respects to these inland resorts. By
the side of the sea here are fewer blossoms and
rather smaller eucalyptus groves, but a greater
number of open-air restaurants and one or two quite
imposing hotels. Indeed, Ramirez, the nearer of the
two, is endowed with a really fine casino, that faces
the shoreward end of the pier, and that has by its
side the spacious and well-timbered public park.</p>

<p>Poçitos occupies the next bay, and is notable for
its lengthy esplanade and for the very pleasant houses
that give upon the semicircular sweep. This bay,
moreover, is the first that has, so to speak, turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
its back upon the river and has faced the open ocean.
As a token, the waters are tinged with a definite
blue, and the air holds a genuine sting of salt that
rapidly dies away when passing up-stream away from
here. To the Buenos Airen, who enthusiastically
patronises the place, Poçitos is delightful, if for no
other reason than the sense of contrast to his own
surroundings that it affords him. Not that he has
any reason to grumble at the river frontier of the
rich alluvial soil, from out of which his fortunes have
been built. But here, in place of the soft, stoneless
mud, is bright sand, and genuine rocks, piled liberally
all over the shore, that shelter crabs, and pools that
hold fish of the varieties that refuse to breathe in
any other but guaranteed salt water. So it is that
the summer season sees the long rows of tents and
bathing machines crowded and overflowing with the
Uruguayans and the host of visitors from across the
river.</p>

<p>Both Ramirez and Poçitos are within the range
of the ubiquitous tramcar. But this very efficient
service, not content with its excursion of half a dozen
miles and more on the ocean side of Montevideo,
runs in the opposite direction completely round the
port bay, and performs the yet more important
journey to Villa del Cerro, the small town that lies
at the foot of the hill that is so closely associated
with Montevideo and its affairs. A far shorter route
to this latter place, however, is by the busy little
steam ferry that puffs straight across the bay, and
that starts faithfully at every hour, as promised by
the timetable, although, if that hour coincides with
the one specified, the event may be accepted as a
fortunate accident.</p>

<p>Its most patriotic inhabitant could not claim loveliness
for Villa del Cerro. The existence of the spot
is mainly due to the presence of some neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">saladeros</i>, or meat-curing factories, and thus the
small town presents the aspects of the more humble
industrial centres. There are two or three regular
streets, it is true, that contain a few houses with
some faint pretensions to importance. Upon the
balconies of these the local señoritas are wont to
gather of an evening. They are obviously a little
starved in such matters as romance, and a little
fearful lest their eye language should lose its
eloquence through too long a disuse. Thus the
advent of any passing stranger whatever suffices to
cause a certain flutter and excitement in the balconies
above.</p>

<p>Outside these main streets the pattern of the town
has been left much to the discretion of its most
lowly inhabitants. Buildings composed of unexpected
material sprout up from the earth in unexpected
places. Earth, boards, tin, and fragments of stone
are amongst the commonest of these, although there
are a certain number, stiffened by bricks, whose
comparatively commonplace exterior looks smug and
respectable by the side of the rest.</p>

<p>Mounting upwards, the architecture of the outskirts
comes as something of a relief, since its simplicity
is crude and absolute to the point of excluding
any jarring possibilities.</p>

<p>The ranchos here are composed of nothing beyond
loose fragments of rock piled one on top of the other,
with an odd hole here and there that serves for
window or door, frequently for both.</p>

<p>At one point in the midst of these primitive stone
dwellings a small group of scantily clothed boys
are playing football, the implement of their game
being an old sheepskin rolled into the nearest imitation
to a globe to which its folds will consent and
held together roughly with string&mdash;one more instance
of the spreading triumph of football, that wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
game that seems to conquer its surroundings and
to implant itself firmly throughout the world entire.</p>

<p>The turf slopes of the Cerro itself are all about
one now. From the distance they had appeared of
an unbroken green, but when actually approached
the broken patches of bare rock upon their surface
become evident. The last of the stone shanties are
not only contrived upon one of these, but constructed
from the very site upon which they repose. The
result is a difficulty to distinguish between the natural
rock and the habitable flakes.</p>

<p>The short turf of the wind-swept Cerro is innocent
of blossoms save for the ubiquitous verbena, a few
stunted tobacco flowers, and some other lowly blooms.
Upon the very summit, where the rock breaks out
boldly and piles itself in jagged heaps, is a picturesque
fort, from the midst of whose walls of solid
masonry rises the dome of the light that guides the
ships into the harbour below.</p>

<p>The panorama that opens itself out from this point
is not a little remarkable. On the one side lies the
bay of Montevideo, thickly dotted with its steamers
and sailing vessels, with the towers and streets of
the capital spreading far inland upon the opposite
shore. Beyond this, again, are the undulations of the
hills, the coastline, and the ocean that shines brilliantly,
although it is only dimly blue. On the other
hand stretches the River Plate, whose waters are
deepening their yellow as they extend towards the
landless horizon, beneath which lies Buenos Aires
and Argentina.</p>

<p>The Cerro guards the entrance to the great river.
It is the first true hill upon its banks&mdash;and the
last, for over a thousand miles. For the next of
its kind signals the approach to Asuncion&mdash;beyond
Argentina and far beyond the Banda Oriental&mdash;in
far-away Paraguay. And much water flows between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the tropical heat of Asuncion and the cool freshness
of this Cerro. Therefore the place is worthy of
mark as the southernmost of the two widely separated
sentinel hills that guard such different climes.</p>

<p>A journey from south to north through the heart of
Uruguay reveals an infinitely greater variety of landscape
and humanity than is suspected by the dwellers
in the better known littoral districts of the land. It
is true that for the purpose the employment of the
homely and convenient railway train is essential.
Although it has been my good fortune to drive for
day after day and for league upon league through
lesser areas of the Uruguayan Campo, to cover such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
lengthy stretch as this by means of coach and horses
is only possible for him who can afford the supreme
luxury of ignoring time.</p>

<p>The first portion of the journey, moreover, although
far from wearisome in the circumstances, is effected
across a landscape almost every league of which
presents the exact replica of its neighbours. Once
clear of the woods, fields, vineyards, orchards, and
flowers that lie so pleasantly to the landward side
of Montevideo, the rolling grass waves of the Campo
come to stretch themselves from horizon to horizon,
rising and dipping with a ceaseless regularity of
sweep until it becomes difficult to believe that the
entire world itself is not composed of these smiling
folds of land.</p>

<p>It is not until nearly three hundred kilometres have
been traversed, and the train has rumbled over the
long bridge that spans the Rio Negro that the first
symptoms of a changing scenery become evident.
The undulations have become less regular, and the
hill-tops are soaring higher into the sky-line. Indeed,
the tendency throughout is towards an exuberance
that has been hitherto lacking. Thus not only the
outbreaks of stone that scar the hill-faces at intervals
are bolder in character now, but the wealth of field
flowers, too, has grown in extent and brilliance.</p>

<p>A broad, glowing bank of the purple <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">flor morala</i>
lines the railway track on either hand, pricking across
the landscape in twin unbroken bands of colour.
Where the loftier flower ceases, the red, white, and
mauve of the verbena clings closely to the turf. At
longer intervals sprout clumps of blue lupin blossom,
while the white mallows, harebells, and tobacco
flowers lurk thickly in between the groves of thistle,
and large yellow marguerites and daisies mingle with
a variegated host of blooms.</p>

<p>The countryside is as sparsely populated as elsewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
League upon league of the great rolling
sweeps of the land spread their panorama unflecked
by a single homestead. So far as the mere picturesque
is concerned, the result is admirable. The soft,
dreamy landscape is at its very best when unburdened
by human habitation. Yet in such cases the picturesque
becomes a luxury won at the expense of the
practical. Undoubtedly from the green background
of the pastures should shine out the white walls
of estancia-houses and ranchos. The time is now
probably near enough when such will actually be the
case; but in the meanwhile the land waits in complacent
patience, sprouting out its grassy covering
with contemptuous ease.</p>

<p>Yet it must not be imagined that the landscape,
however lonely, is altogether deserted. Now and
then may be discerned the clump of trees that stand
out like islands from the sea to shelter the dwellings
of the owners of these great areas of soil. At long
intervals, too, springs up a hedge of tall cactus that
flanks the humble rancho, whose tin roof, as often
as not, is held down in its place by means of small
boulders&mdash;a feature of architecture that recalls the
châlets of Switzerland, although it is certain enough
that the respective buildings have nothing else in
common.</p>

<p>Here and there graze the dumb supporters of the
homesteads&mdash;herds of cattle, troops of horses, and
flocks of sheep. These districts of the centre have
not yet attained to the standard of breeding that
characterises the lands that fringe the great rivers
to the south and west. Thus, the cattle, although
sufficiently fat and sleek, lack the finish of the more
aristocratic Hereford. Shaggy of coat, long of horn,
and exhibiting an utter lack of restraint in the
strangely varied colour scheme of their bodies, they
are essentially of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">criollo</i>, or native, order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of these licensed occupiers
of the pastures are others whose existence is more
precarious. These are hares who race away at the
advent of a train, and iguanas whose long tails stream
behind them as they depart in a flurry. As for
the ostriches, they have obviously come to the conclusion
that their life is too short and their neck too
long for any excitement of the kind. They are plainly
bored by the advent of this noisy invention of man,
and regard it languidly from the height of the two
long legs that repose in a supercilious attitude.</p>

<p>On through the undulating Campo, where the rain
pools lie like dew ponds upon an English South
Down, and where the banks of the intermittent
streams of the cañadas thread in and out of the
green grass for all the world like the bodies of black
snakes. A company of deer are feeding peacefully
in the distance, intermingled with the bulky members
of a herd of cattle with whom the wild creatures have
condescended to associate for the time being.</p>

<p>The train has pulled up at Cardoso now, the centre
of a district that is considerably more populous than
the majority. The place was once the site of a
German colony, and indeed the sole reasons why it
does not remain so to this day must be laid at the
doors of climate, surroundings, intermarriage, and
the influence of all three. As it is, chastened by
the all-powerful atmosphere of the spot, Teutonic
features, customs, and language have already become
modified almost to the extinction of the original type.</p>

<p>The phenomenon affords only one more of the
innumerable instances of the tremendous power of
absorption that is latent in the South American continent.
In contrast to the mutability of all things
intrinsically human, the industry of the community
remains the same as when the first colonists, strangers
and foreigners, introduced it to the spot. Cheese-making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
is still the staple trade of Cardoso, and the
district is not a little famed for the art.</p>

<p>This particular neighbourhood, however, is to be
noted for something of more enduring importance
than cheese. It is here, indeed, that the soil of the
land, after many tentative swellings, each more
ambitious than the last, takes upon itself to change
its outline in a determined and conclusive fashion.
The universal, gentle swell of the undulations has
given way to steeper walls of green surmounted by
curiously level, flat surfaces. Thus the face of the
Campo is now dotted, so far as the eye can reach, with
a collection of table-lands, each separate and differing
slightly from the rest in the details of its pattern,
but each marvellously distinct and clearly cut. The
feature is characteristic of central northern Uruguay,
and is continued well beyond the frontier into Brazil.</p>

<p>Obeying the sociable instinct that so frequently
links the railway line with the highway in these
parts of the world, the main road runs close alongside
the locomotive track. Where it goes the dark,
rich soil gleams moistly in every dip, and each cup
in the land holds its pool, for heavy rains have
preceded the brilliant sunshine of the day.</p>

<p>For many leagues the broad surface of the way
has been broken by nothing beyond the inevitable
attributes of such thoroughfares&mdash;the occasional
pathetic heap that stands for the dead body of a
horse or cow, or the bleaching framework of bones
that gleam out sharply after the vultures' and
caranchos' feast. But here at length comes a body
of riders, half a dozen Gauchos, enveloped in ponchos
of various patterns, who are pricking onwards at
the easy canter that renders the conquest of any space
whatever a question of mere time.</p>

<p>Thudding over the hill-tops, splashing through the
mud-holes below, the progress of the grim, silent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
centaurs is as inevitable and certain as the presence
of the knives at their belts or the maté-bowl slung
by the saddles. Then the train has sped ahead, dragging
after it a world of its own as remote from
the atmosphere that surrounds the six diminishing
horsemen as is the clank of the engine from the light
jingling of the silvered bridles.</p>

<p>The crop of stone upon the land has become more
prolific. The rock has come to adorn the sides of
the table-lands more especially, breaking out with
precision at the spot where each slope of the green
eminences starts out abruptly from the level, after
which it continues, unbroken, to the summit. The
material, however, has been made to serve for
purposes of utility, and here and there are corrals
and walls of loosely piled stones, a novel sight
to one who is working his way upwards from the
south.</p>

<p>The scarce ranchos, however, continue on much
the same pattern that has characterised them throughout
the journey. The crudeness of many of these is
scarcely to be excelled in any part of the world. To
imagine an edifice composed of the lids and sides
of kerosene tins, roofed and finished off at the odd
corners by straggling tufts of reed, is to picture the
abode of by no means the most humble settler.</p>

<p>One or two are embellished, it is true, by a rough
trellis work from which the vine-leaves hang thickly,
while others are decorated by nothing beyond a
variety of multi-coloured garments that hang out in
the sunshine to dry. Clustered together, the modest
homesteads would appear sordid and mean. As it
is, the open solitudes of which each stands as the
human centre lend it a certain dignity that is not
in the least concerned with the pattern of the
structure itself.</p>

<p>The train has halted at a couple of small "Camp"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
stations, and has puffed onwards again, leaving the
respective brick buildings, with their scatter of outhouses,
to sink back into the lethargy that the passenger
train disturbs but for a few minutes every
other day. In the neighbourhood of Achar, the
latter of these halts, the surrounding country has
broken out into an exceptional blaze of flower. The
purple of the flor morala stains hillsides entire; the
scarlet verbena glows in spreading patches that from
a distance might well be mistaken for poppy-fields,
while all about are other flower carpets of yellow,
blue, and white.</p>

<p>The wealth of blossom continues unbroken as far
as Piedra Sola, or Solitary Stone&mdash;a spot aptly named
from a curious square block of rock that reposes upon
the top of a mound in so monumental a fashion that
it is difficult to believe that it is the work of Nature
rather than of human beings&mdash;and beyond it, adorning
a country that grows ever bolder until Tambores
is reached.</p>

<p>All the attributes in these primitive parts savour
of Nature and of its simplicity. The very nomenclature
is affected by this influence. Thus no historical
significance is to be looked for in the name of
Tambores&mdash;drums. The origin of the word lies in the
surrounding table-lands that have grown loftier and
more accentuated here than their brethren to the
south, and whose shape resembles not a little the
instruments of war.</p>

<p>Tambores is a place of comparative importance. It
is true that no architectural beauties are to be looked
for at the spot, since the quaint collection of edifices
that are scattered in the neighbourhood of the station
are almost without exception the tin and reed
structures common to the district. Such rare exceptions
as exist, moreover, hold out merely minor claims
to aristocracy in the shape of an entire sheet or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
two of corrugated iron. Yet these modest precincts
guard a really important cattle and wool centre, and
even now many hundreds of bales are lying in readiness
in their wagons, while cattle stamp impatiently
in the trucks that will bear them southwards to
Montevideo.</p>

<p>Passing to and fro by the honeysuckle hedge that
flanks the platform is a motley collection of folk.
The majority of the men are in sad-coloured ponchos,
and in <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bombachos</i> that frequent staining has imbued
with an earthy hue. In addition to the railway
officials, beshawled women, children, dogs, and hens
complete the gathering. A feature that is especially
noticeable here is the number of dusky complexions
that have come to assert themselves in the midst of
the fresh-coloured Uruguayan faces. Quite distinct
from the swarthiness of the Indian, the tint here
savours undoubtedly of the African. It becomes,
moreover, steadily more marked as the Brazilian
frontier is approached.</p>

<p>Indeed, the evidence of variety is everywhere.
Even the conventional aspect of the train itself and
of its passengers has undergone no little alteration
since the start. As it pulled out from Montevideo
the train was undoubtedly a model of its kind
that took no little pride in its well-ordered level
line of day coaches, and sleeping and restaurant
cars.</p>

<p>Once well out into the country, however, the democratic
influence of the land has overcome its patrician
make-up. A passenger coach or two has dropped
away at one station; some trucks and goods-vans
have been added at another, until its appearance has
become as heterogeneous as that of a Uruguayan
volunteer soldier in a revolution. In fact, the farther
from the capital it gets and the nearer to its destination,
the more <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">négligé</i> and doubtless practical does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
its appearance become. Like to a man who starts
out for a walk on a hot summer's day, it is metaphorically
trudging along bareheaded, with its coat
slung over its shoulder.</p>

<p>In the case of the passengers the same may be
said without the apology of metaphor. It is in the
occupants of the first-class coaches that the transformation
is most evident. Many of the men remain
in at least portions of the same clothes of metropolitan
cut that served them in Montevideo. But
ponchos have now been brought out and donned
to hide what lies beneath&mdash;ponchos of fine texture,
these, that stand quite apart from the meaner
drapings of the <em>peon</em>, but nevertheless essentially
national and of the land.</p>

<p>As for the women, the few who have remained
constant to the train since the beginning of the
journey remain in much the same trim as when they
first entered the carriage. The persistence may be
due to the vanity that is alleged by man to be
inherent in woman, or merely to the laudable desire
of giving the country cousin an object-lesson in
costume.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the garments of these
latter tend to comfort somewhat at the expense of
appearances. The loosest of blouses, wraps, and
skirts are wont to make up a figure in which a waist
may at times be suspected, and even occasionally
hoped for, but is never seen. Decidedly the procedure
savours of rigid honesty on the part of the
country cousin. For frankly to promise nothing is
surely more admirable than the transient advertisement
achieved by the manufacture of merely temporary
space in the position rightfully sought for
by superfluous material.</p>

<p>Many of these country ladies with the honest and
unaccentuated figures are accompanied by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
maids, these latter for the most part negresses. The
bond between mistress and maid is very close here.
Indeed, in Northern Uruguay such episodes as a
"month's warning," a demand for an extra "night
out," the right to "followers," and all other similar
bones of contention that arise in more populous
centres between employer and employed are unknown.</p>

<p>Here the maid, whether she be negress, mottled,
or white, obtains an assured, if minor, footing in the
family circle. Not only her love affairs but her
appetite will call forth the ready sympathy of her
mistress. Seated together, their meals will be shared
in common, as indeed is occurring in the case of
sandwiches and wine in the railway carriage even
now. To complete the patriarchial atmosphere, the
railway guard has joined one of the groups in
question in order to assist, purely platonically, at the
impromptu meal, and his manner is equally courteous
towards señora and maid.</p>

<p>It is certain that he who travels in the remoter
parts must put aside all preconceived notions of
degree and appearances. Close by is seated a group
of young men who are discussing the opera in Montevideo
with critical fervour. After a while the conversation,
as is inevitable, turns upon politics, and
the arguments and views are bandied to and fro
with the eloquence common to the race.</p>

<p>But there is original philosophy here, whether
sound or otherwise. Schemes for alleviating the lot
of the humble worker follow hard upon the heels of
topics of municipal reform, parliamentary procedure,
and the vexed and intricate question of where the
Uruguayan-Argentine frontier floats in the broad
dividing river. The phrases are wonderfully apt,
the proposals astonishingly daring. During a pause
in the political discussion one of the debaters explains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
his own walk in life. He is a jeweller's assistant.
Another is head waiter in a Montevidean hotel. These
products of the land are undoubtedly bewildering.
Each has been talking like a prime minister.</p>

<p>Tambores has been left behind, and the train is
speeding once again through the undulations and
table-lands of the pastures. Although the new-comer
is unaware of the fact, the climax of the journey is
drawing near, and one of the most remarkable transformations
in Nature is about to reveal itself with
the suddenness of a pantomimic stage-shifting.</p>

<p>That the stranger to the land should remain unaware
of what lies before him is not surprising.
The rolling downs have encompassed him in unbroken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
sequence from the moment that the outermost suburb
of Montevideo was left behind. They are about him
now, sinking and rising until their smooth green
sweeps upwards in long waves against the blue
horizon. Never was a fresher, blowier country, with
its every inch open and bare to the sunlight and
breeze. It is difficult to imagine such a land rubbing
shoulders with a landscape less frank and guileless.
Its only fitting boundaries are white cliffs,
and, beyond them, the wide ocean.</p>

<p>Yet if Nature aspired to human ideals of consistency
the hills would go hopping to many a queer
tune. After all, it is best to leave it to arrange
its surprises in its own way. The first symptom
of a coming change is afforded by the appearance
of a growth that has remained a stranger to the
landscape until now. Rock plants, with thick, heavy,
silver leaves and snowy blossoms rise up thickly of
a sudden to whiten the ground. Then without warning
the train is speeding downwards through the
rock walls of a cutting that seems to have opened
out from the ground at the call of an Open Sesame
steam-whistle. Two or three hundred yards of a
steep descent that makes a precipice out of the stone
side on either hand, then a rapid widening of the
barrier to the view&mdash;and the thing is done! The
train has entered the Valley of Eden.</p>

<p>Just as Adam in his fig-leaf gasped in dismay
at his eviction from the garden, so does the modern
traveller in boots and buttons exclaim in surprise
as he passes through the stone gateway of this later
Eden. The two or three hundred yards have made
an incredible memory of the open downland. In
its place are rugged cliffs to right and left, at the
base of which dense sub-tropical forest sends its
waves upwards to cling to the stone sides as far
as they may.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>In the centre of the valley is a stream that goes
rippling over its rocky bed, overhung with a curtain
of flowering trees that hold strange nests within their
branches, and the festoons of the lianas that plunge
thickly downwards towards the earth. The scene,
in fact, holds all the enthusiastic variety of the sub-tropics.
Nothing is wanting to the picture. The
rock, leaves, flowers, palms, and the vivid patches
of smooth green by the edge of the stream have
as accessories the turkey-buzzards and black vultures
carving their lazy circles above, and the brilliant
host of butterflies beneath that float airily to and
fro as though to outflash even the wonderful feathers
of the local woodpecker.</p>

<p>The train, as though itself entirely taken aback
by these new aspects of Nature, has been proceeding
at little beyond human walking pace. Now it has
drawn up by the side of a modest building and a
few surrounding huts that are almost smothered in
the verdure. Eden station! The sight of the place
is far less incongruous than the sound. As a matter
of fact the valley itself is well named. No spot
could better endow with its glamour the simple life
that endures until the inevitable boredom leads to
the death of innocence. Nevertheless, the railway
company should reserve special accommodation for
the garden. Let the traveller proceed to Margate
or Southend as he likes. But a third-class ticket
to Eden! The thing is inconceivable, yet it is done
every day.</p>

<p>The advent of the train, however, affords a harvest
to at least one inhabitant of this secluded and fair
corner. An aged negro, who was undoubtedly born
a slave across the Brazilian frontier, is slowly
hobbling the length of the train collecting toll from
the passengers as he goes. In South America are
two professions that stand apart from all the rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Failing the status of a millionaire, become a beggar
by all means! As regards a profitable occupation,
not one of the intermediate walks of life can equal
the extremes at the social poles. That of politician
is perhaps nearest akin to both; but, intrinsically,
the phrase is transitory, since a rapid absorption at
one end or the other is practically inevitable.</p>

<p>The aged negro is collecting his dues with grave
complacency. A general dealer in receipts, his profits
are by no means restricted to mere cash. Business
in centavos is amazingly brisk; but so are the transactions
in cigarettes, cigars, fruit, and morsels of
food. Ere the train starts the benignity has grown
deep upon the old man's face. When the place is
lonely and still once more he will totter back to his
tiny reed hut, with its insignificant patch of maize,
and will smoke, and eat, and drink, in senile enjoyment
of the lengthy holiday that separates his tri-weekly
half-hours of work. He may thank the God
of beggars that he was born in a Latin land.</p>

<p>The train is moving onwards once again, and the
bold grey cliffs and bluffs recede as the valley widens.
Although the first full beauty of the scene has lost
by the expansion, the wealth of colour remains. The
forest trees for the most part are flecked with brilliant
yellow, while the surface of the swamps that now
cover the centre of the valley are thickly spangled
with the pure white of their own broad blossoms.</p>

<p>But an attempt to describe the various growths
would be the task of a botanist. One alone must
be described for its striking propensities if for
nothing beyond. In all directions are bushes of
glowing mauve flower&mdash;or, at least, so they appear at
the first glimpse to the eye. The sight is not a little
amazing, since many of the shrubs, a dozen feet in
height, are covered from top to bottom with an unbroken
coat of petals. A nearer inspection solves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the mystery some while after. The flower itself is
a parasite, an everlasting sweet pea, that goes the
length of concealing from sight the bush on which
it depends.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the valley has widened until
the well-defined cliffs that hemmed in its beginning
have disappeared altogether. But the country
remains entirely distinct from the open Campo
that preceded the gate of Eden. There is pasture
here, it is true, but it is pasture broken and intersected
by woodland, river courses, ravines, and
mountains. It is curious to remark that among the
latter, although many are bold and lofty, there is
not a peak to be met with. In obedience to what
appears to be a hard-and-fast law of the hills, the
top of each is shorn evenly across, leaving a flat
and level summit.</p>

<p>The country is one of tobacco now as well as
of maize, and the aspect of the cultivators coincides
to a great extent with the popular notions of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise en scène</i> of the tobacco-fields. The population
of the tiny mud huts that decorate the land is almost
entirely negro, and the inevitable piccaninny is much
in evidence, having apparently escaped in shoals from
the London music-hall stage. The costume of the
younger boys, however, would scarcely pass muster
in a more conventional neighbourhood. The sole
garment of many of the younger ones consists of a
shirt, and a very frayed one at that&mdash;a costume
that is eminently suitable to the palm-tree, but
criminal beneath the oak.</p>

<p>The next halt is at a place of importance, one
of the chief features, in fact, of the Far North.
Tacuarembo numbers a population of almost eight
thousand, which, although the figure may not impress
the outer world, renders the spot something of an
urban giant in the neighbourhood. As though to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
compensate for its lack of imposing buildings,
Tacuarembo is exceedingly picturesque. With its
avenues of tall trees, and its houses peering everywhere
from beneath the shade of an unusual richness
of vegetation, the place is sufficiently delightful and
striking in its own fashion.</p>

<p>The station itself gives the keynote to the aspects
of the place. Within half a dozen yards of where
the white steam goes hissing upwards from the engine
the green young peaches hang in thick clusters from
their branches. To their side is a hedge of blossoming
roses that continues until the flowery architecture
changes abruptly to a wall of golden
honeysuckle. At the rear of this, surrounding the
outer yard of the place, are poplars and eucalyptus,
while the heavy scent of the purple paraiso-tree
overpowers the fainter colours of the mimosa.</p>

<p>A dozen or so of the local "coches" are waiting
in the shade of all these and in that of the vines
that clamber upwards by their side. They are crude
affairs, whose lack of paint and polish is more than
counteracted by the dictatorial attitudes of the
brigand-like drivers who lounge at ease upon the
boxes. It must be admitted that the manners of
these latter are far less formidable than their appearance.
Indeed, they smile far more graciously than
the corresponding metropolitan tyrants of South
America as they drive off one by one, bearing away
their patrons beneath the shady avenues.</p>

<p>The majority of folk, however, remain for some
while to chat together, since in these parts the railway
station is an accepted centre of sociability. The
queer medley of the crowd possesses its own charm.
A group of officers in dark uniforms and red kepis
rub shoulders with Gauchos and peones in dark
clothes and black or blue <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bombachos</i>. Beyond is a
knot of women in the homely and loose costume of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the district, bare-headed, and with hair drawn tightly
back to be wound into a plain knot at the back
of the head. An elaborate dandy, dressed ostentatiously
in the favourite black from head to foot,
is extracting a few centavos from the pockets of
his shining velvet waistcoat with which to endow
a couple of dissolute-looking beggars who have
drawn near.</p>

<p>Although the jet-black faces of the negroes
and the browner tints of the half-castes are much
in evidence, the countenances of the true Uruguayans
remain remarkably fair and fresh. Indeed, the
features of many are unusually handsome, and
curiously untouched by the stress of heat and
climate.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking of all in the neighbourhood
is the tall figure of one who has detached
himself from a group of friends, and is walking
toward where a line of tethered horses is waiting.
Like the other who has been distributing alms to
the beggar, he is clad from head to foot in black.
Nevertheless, the aspects of the two are as different
as night and day. The one is a walker of the
streets, this latter a true lord of the Campo. Unmistakably
a landed proprietor of no little consideration,
his costume affects the Gaucho to a marked
degree. With scarf wound negligently round his
neck, loose jacket, and broad bombachos, the spotless
black of the finest material is finished off by the
light boots of the man whose life is spent in the
saddle. In his hand the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rebenque</i>&mdash;the inevitable
riding-whip&mdash;glistens with its silver carving, a work
of art.</p>

<p>None could deny the coquetry of his appearance;
but this is the stern coquetry of the warrior and
hunter, as a glance at his grave, rather hawklike
features will confirm. A strikingly handsome figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
of a man, he stalks with assured tread, raising his
sombrero with a simple gesture to acquaintances,
until he reaches the spot where the line of horses
are tethered. His mount is a magnificent bay, whose
leathers and bridle are silvered as thickly as they
may be and yet remain flexible, while the saddle
and stirrups are heavily coated with the same
material. He has swung himself into the saddle now,
and is riding away, forcing his horse with consummate
ease into a series of curvets and caracoles that
evoke admiration even from the numerous professional
centaurs in the crowd. But the rider never once
looks back as he swings away in the shade of the
trees. The romantic figure is either unconscious of
admiration or too accustomed to the tribute to be
concerned. In any case, he is a product of the
land, a veritable paladin.</p>

<p>To the north of Tacuarembo are grass hills overshadowed
by the inevitable tall table-lands. Where
the rock juts out from the side of these the fronds
of many varieties of fern sprout thickly, and by
their sides are clumps of evening primrose, everlasting
pea, and a wealth of far more brilliant
blossoms of the tropical order. In the hollows
the vegetation of the wooded streams grows ever
more luxurious, and here the flowers star the banks
in the wildest riot of profusion.</p>

<p>Seeing that it is springtime, all this is as it should
be. But there cannot be many parts of the world
whose inhabitants are permitted such a striking reminder
of the season as is the case just here. In
the neighbourhood of one of these enchanting
streams is a very humble mud hut. Its dwellers
are pure Africans, and they are just without, enjoying
a sun-bath with all the zest of the race.</p>

<p>But the interest of this particular spot is not concerned
with them at all; it is centred upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
modest homestead itself. The mud walls have responded
in an amazing fashion to the call of the
year. Not content with a background of lichen and
moss, they have flung out lengthy streamers of fern,
from amidst which peer shyly the blossoms of various
plants. Obedient to the impulse of spring, each of
the four sides has garbed itself thus. In less
exuberant parts the effect would be strained for with
toil and achieved with triumph. But here the black
inhabitants regard their eloquent house as a matter
of course.</p>

<p>Just after leaving the small station of Bañada de
Rocha is a tunnel. This fact may appear totally unworthy
of mention&mdash;anywhere else but within the
countries bordering on the River Plate. Here a tunnel
is an object to be paused at, and to be inspected with
not a little curiosity. Although it is possible that
some minor burrowings may exist, to the best of
my belief the three republics of Argentina, Uruguay,
and Paraguay can count no more than two regular
tunnels between them. The wonderful shaft bored
through the heart of the Andes is one&mdash;the other
is before us here at Bañada de Rocha. As the
only specimen of its kind in Uruguay, therefore, it
is not without distinction, and is worthy of at least
a passing remark.</p>

<p>After passing through the tunnel the line drops
down into a fairly wide plain, hemmed in by numerous
low ranges of the inevitable flat-topped hills, while
a few elevations of the same curious nature dot the
country in the nearer neighbourhood of the track.
In a short while, however, the more broken country
has surged up all about once again, bearing upon
its surface quaint rocky projections, some shaped
exactly as tables, others in the form of sugar-loaves,
while yet others resemble giant mushrooms sprouting
cumbrously from the soil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Ere reaching the station of Paso del Cerro a great
grove of carolina-trees rises majestically, and in the
grateful shadow of the branches a long line of bullock-wagons,
each vehicle loaded with the wool for which
the region is noted, goes winding its way towards
the station in the stolid fashion of such processions.
Paso del Cerro is delightfully situated, facing as
it does a range of hills whose surface is dotted with
ranches that appear picturesque enough in the
distance. Beyond this point lofty cliffs of rock soar
aloft, pressing near to the line. In the nooks and
crannies of the great walls are dwarf trees of fantastic
shapes that make pleasant breaks here and there
in the bare rock of the surface.</p>

<p>A little farther on the colour of the soil begins
to undergo a transformation, and soon the red
sandstone&mdash;the colour that is typical of the same, as
well as the more northern, latitudes in the surrounding
republics&mdash;is stretching everywhere to join with
the green in dominating the landscape. A few
more wayside stations, and then Rivera and the
Brazilian frontier are drawing near, while the
mountain ranges that mark the Brazilian territory
are already in sight.</p>

<p>Rivera is a town of no little local importance,
small though its extent may be as it nestles in a
hollow in the midst of the hills. The soft pink of
its buildings and the red of its roads and hillsides
contrast delightfully with the green foliage and
brilliant flowers with which the spot is so liberally
endowed. Rivera, moreover, is a place that can lay
claim to some quite notable characteristics of its
own. It possesses, for instance, a magnificent avenue,
the Sarandi, that stretches for over a mile, shaded
by trees for all its length, from off the central portion
of which lies the pretty little plaza.</p>

<p>The best view of both the town and of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
surrounding country is to be obtained from the
solitary hill near by that marks the boundary between
the two republics, and that bears upon its summit
an old and battered boundary-stone. Viewed from
here the panorama is fascinating. To the north,
and immediately below, lies Santa Ana, the Brazilian
sister-township of Rivera, that sends out its buildings
almost to join walls with those of the Uruguayan.
Santa Ana itself presents a picturesque enough
prospect with its white houses and luxuriant gardens,
its wide, unpaved, shadeless streets, its rambling
barracks, and its red-bricked bullring. As a background
to this bright, sunlit picture, and one that
throws it into strong relief, rise range upon range
of the dark hills with their shaven summits, starting
up abruptly in the first instance from the confines of
the town itself, and fading away gradually into the
misty distance of the province of Rio Grande.
Skirting the base of the hill to the east is a short
avenue devoid of buildings that serves as the frontier
line, and marks with no little emphasis where one
town ends and the other begins. The significance
of the spot is accentuated by the sight of the sentry-boxes
of the frontier guards and custom officials.
To the south, reclining in its own hollow, lies Rivera,
with its shady avenues and its conspicuous round-towered
church.</p>

<p>The aspects of the two towns are curiously different,
considering the fact that from their absolute propinquity
they form to all intents and purposes a
single city. In the first place the difference in the
tint of each is marked. The general colour of the
Rivera houses is red, while that of Santa Ana is
pure white. The distinction is merely the result of
differing national customs. The houses of both places
are constructed of precisely similar stone, but the
Brazilian prefers to face his walls with plaster.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Autres pays, autres moeurs</i>; but it is seldom that
the contrast may be viewed from so near at hand.
The architecture, moreover, of the Santa Ana
buildings is of a much squarer and older design
than that of those in the Uruguayan town. The
former city, as a matter of fact, is considerably more
ancient than the latter, to which not only the growing
timber but the buildings as well bear witness.
In Santa Ana the trees, although not nearly so
numerous, have attained to far grander proportions
than has been the case with those across the border.</p>

<p>If one should not judge humanity from outward
appearance, the procedure is even less wise in dealing
with a collection of human habitations. Feminine
powder and rouge are as mere toys in the matter
of guile compared with the alluring scenic effect
that a city is capable of producing by means of
bricks and mortar. Judged from the summit of the
hill without, Santa Ana presents an even more inviting
appearance than that of Rivera. Once within the
walls the aspects of the situation alter abruptly.
Santa Ana possesses one spot of beauty, it is true.
Its luxuriant and shady plaza where the date-palms
flourish is an oasis of delight set in the midst of
sordid surroundings and dusty heat. With this
exception, it must be admitted that the place is
shadeless, dirty, and evil-smelling.</p>

<p>The streets of Rivera, on the contrary, are clean,
well paved, and sheltered from the rays of the sun
by the innumerable green branches that stretch so
pleasantly above. The townsfolk, moreover, differ
less from those of Montevideo than might be
imagined, although the heat of the climate has been
responsible for a rather sallower and swarthier type.</p>

<p>A feature that is not a little remarked upon by those
who have entered Uruguay from the stoneless Pampa
of Argentina is the excellence of the roads that
surround Montevideo, and of several, indeed, that
penetrate for a considerable distance inland. The
highway to the town of San José, for instance, that
extends for ninety-six kilometres is macadamised
throughout its length, and is, moreover, excellently
constructed and sustained.</p>

<p>The benefits of convenient deposits of stone are
strikingly emphasised here. Now that a start has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
been made, there is no reason why efficient roads of
the kind should not pierce the countryside in all
directions. For, notwithstanding the natural fertility
of its soil, there is scarcely a corner throughout the
whole length and breadth of the Republic that is not
seamed to a smaller or larger extent with these
layers of useful stone, the eruption of which frequently
marks the surface itself of the land.</p>

<p>The road to San José, as a matter of fact, is by
no means the only important one of its kind. There
are various similar specimens, equally well constructed
if of less imposing length. A very
admirable road leads from the capital to the small
town of Pando in the neighbouring province of
Canelones. The journey by motor-car is an easy
one, and renders an admirable insight into the nature
of the country in this particular district.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the least smooth portion of this
highway is represented by a mile or so of its length
on the outskirts of Montevideo itself. This point
once passed, however, the undulations in the surface
of the road die away, and the broad grey thoroughfare
stretches with remarkable smoothness over hill and
dale. The car can snort along at the utmost speed
its power will permit, since the grey band opens
out ahead with a refreshing openness that is totally
devoid of secrecy, and only at the lengthiest intervals
is its surface darkened by the form of a rider or of
a lumbering country cart.</p>

<p>The progress is of the switchback order, with
long-drawn-out rises and falls that are effected with
alternate exuberance and strainings, while on either
hand the fields, verdure, and masses of fruit blossom
speed by in very pleasant sequence. For a spring
shower has laid the dust, and when the Oriental landscape
smiles, its countenance is supremely fascinating.
As though to add just the tinge of sombreness that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
requisite for the accentuation of the delightful scene,
a dark forest of eucalyptus stands out here and there
by the way, the massive serried trunks and branches
painting the landscape with a heavy splash of gloom.</p>

<p>For the first few leagues the aspect of the country&mdash;although
the great variety of its attributes preserves
it entirely from the taint of mere monotony&mdash;remains
much the same. After a while, however, the skyline
to the right becomes lightened in a rather remarkable
fashion. The foreground is a medley of green,
brown, and purple&mdash;rendered respectively by the hills,
trees, orchards, and a patch or two of ploughed soil.
At the back of these rich colours a range of very
lofty snow-white sand-dunes has risen up. The
gleaming barrier marks the frontier-line of the
land; upon its farther side, invisible, of course,
from inland, are the breakers of the South Atlantic
Ocean. Indeed, the effect of this spotless range,
when viewed from the shoreward side, is doubly
curious, since the verdant landscape that leads right
up to them gives no other indication of the propinquity
of the sea.</p>

<p>To the north-east elevations of quite another kind
have been slowly rising upwards from the horizon
as the car speeds along. As the town of Pando
itself is more nearly approached, the distant mountains
of Minas have swollen into view to assert themselves
in a fashion that is not to be overlooked.
Great rounded masses piled in dim purple against the
horizon, their aspect presents a sharp contrast to
that of the dunes close by. The latter are shadowless
things, clear-cut and wanting in depth for all
their purity; the inland mountains are deep and
secretive, with an outline that confounds itself
mysteriously with the sky.</p>

<p>The town of Pando itself is remarkable for little
in the way of commercial or industrial development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
beyond forming the centre of a very flourishing agricultural
district. The place possesses a quaint red-brick
church, the walls of which are adorned with a
curious number of balconies. With this exception
the buildings are unpretentious; but almost every
one is lent its own particular charm by the wealth
of gardens and shade-trees with which the spot is
endowed. Pando, indeed, is one of those very
pleasant minor urban centres with which Uruguay
is so plentifully besprinkled, with its delightful surroundings
of orchards, vineyards, and cultivated land
planted here and there with eucalyptus forests and
with groves of other trees. In the near neighbourhood
of the town runs a typical Uruguayan stream, its
banks thickly lined with verdure, more especially
with the weeping willows whose branches droop
downwards in a thick green curtain over the water's
edge.</p>

<p>It is at this placid rural centre that the macadamised
road ends. There is no mistaking the
terminus of the metalled highway. One turn of the
wheels of the car has left the smooth, hard surface
behind&mdash;and then begins quite another order of going.
The progress of an automobile over a representative
local road of the country partakes of many elements,
amongst others of those of steeplechasing, toboganning,
and of the switchback railways common to
those centres less well provided with natural forms
of excitement. The mounds and valleys of the way
provide an unbroken succession of surprises to which
the car responds by lurching and dipping wildly,
although the dexterity of the driver keeps it staggering
upon its four wheels. Nevertheless, a very little
of this goes a long&mdash;or an incredibly short&mdash;way. So
after a while the nose of the car is turned&mdash;a
manoeuvre that demands as much caution as putting
a small boat about in a gale&mdash;and the vehicle bumps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
its way back again through the smiling outskirts of
Pando to come to rest, as it were, upon the hard,
grey road again.</p>

<p>The sand-dunes of which a glimpse has been
obtained at Piriapolis are characteristic of almost
the entire length of the Uruguayan coast that gives
upon the Atlantic Ocean. There are many spots
along this open shore that are well worthy of a visit.
Not the least of these is Piriapolis&mdash;a place that is
in the act of making a very bold bid for popularity
as a pleasure resort. Piriapolis is a spot of no little
interest. Situated a little to the west of Maldonado
on the southern coast that faces the open Atlantic,
the place is a budding town, and is noteworthy
as much for what it promises in the future as
for its present aspects, interesting enough though
they are. Piriapolis is remarkable in being a one-man
place&mdash;by which no connection is implied with
the one-horse epithet of tradition&mdash;in that it has
emanated from the mind and pocket of a prominent
Uruguayan, Señor Francisco Piria.</p>

<p>Piriapolis lies to the coastward side of the railway
line that is being prolonged in the direction of
Maldonado, and, as matters at present stand, it is
necessary to board a construction train, and to proceed
soberly along the unballasted track to the point
where the coach, with its four horses abreast, waits
in readiness to complete the journey. It must be
admitted that the road that goes rising and falling
over the hilly country is not good. The future will
doubtless endow the district with a network of highways
of quite another kind.</p>

<p>But Piriapolis is young. Hence the unfortunate
wagon that is lit upon, shortly after the start, stuck
hard and fast in the deep mud of a hollow. In the
way of good Samaritans, horses are detached from
the coach to assist in the struggle; but the tenacious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
mud clings in unyielding obstinacy to its wheeled
prey. In the end the contest is abandoned for the
time being; the lent horses return to their place in
front of the coach, and the driver of the wagon
departs gloomily to scour the neighbouring country
in search of oxen.</p>

<p>As the coach proceeds, the way lies through a wild
and mountainous country that bears not a little resemblance
to portions of the South West of Ireland.
But here in the place of the whitewashed Irish cabins
are mud ranchos, almost every one of which reposes
beneath the sheltering branches of its own particular
unit or group of ombú-trees.</p>

<p>After a little more than an hour's drive the
aspect of the country to the front changes abruptly,
and presently the coach enters the cool shade of a
great forest of eucalyptus and pine. It is difficult
to conceive these stretches of giant trees as not
having covered the soil for generations. Yet less
than twenty years ago the face of this particular
district was as bare as any of that of the surrounding
country, since it is only eighteen years ago that
Señor Piria planted the first sapling that went to form
this present forest land.</p>

<p>Roads of a better order now prick their way the
length of the woodland aisles, and after a while a
lonely little store and post-office stand out from
amidst the trees. A little beyond evidences of
civilisation appear quite unexpectedly. A pair of
fine wrought-iron gates are to the front. Once
through these an avenue, adorned by statues at intervals
of a few yards, leads to a square turreted
building that is known as the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">castillo</i>, or castle, of
Señor Piria himself. The dwelling is a pleasant one,
with its broad stone terraces that overlook pretty
grounds, covered with semi-tropical trees, shrubs,
and flowers, laid out after the Italian style.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>The view obtained from the upper terrace here is
decidedly beautiful. Beyond the gardens spread
broad orchards and vineyards, and at the back of
these again on one side is a belt of forest that covers
the ground for seven miles and more until the edge
of the sea itself is reached&mdash;a sparkling line of blue
that is visible in the distance from here. On the
opposite side rises a rugged hill of immense queer-shaped
boulders, from the interstices of which grows
a dense tangle of scrub.</p>

<p>By far the most conspicuous object, however, in
the whole panorama is the aptly named Pan de
Azucar, or Sugar Loaf Mountain, that rises to a
height of some two thousand feet on the west of the
castle. The hill is a bare mass of serrated rock,
and represents one of the highest points in the
Republic. It is the dominating feature in a landscape
that affords a wonderful combination of
mountain, valley, forest, and sea.</p>

<p>The architecture of the castillo itself is somewhat
original. The ground floor is almost entirely
occupied by the guests' bedrooms, apartments with
great vaulted ceilings that open promiscuously the
one into the other. The living apartments are on
the first floor, and the walls of the central hall are
hung with many old Italian paintings. Above this
again is the square tower that stands as the summit
of the house. I mention the architecture more
particularly, since it is entirely unusual, the ordinary
country houses of Uruguay being almost without
exception constructed on a single floor.</p>

<p>The seven miles of eucalyptus forest that intervene
between the castillo and the sea afford a delightful
drive to the shore of Piriapolis Bay. This portion
of the coast consists of a shelving sandy shore
eminently suited for the purposes of bathing, and is
backed by an imposing vista of forest and mountain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
The hill immediately behind the bay, by the way,
is locally known as the Sierra de los Ingleses, having
been employed, it is said, for the purposes of
smuggling in the old days by English sailors.</p>

<p>It is at this point that the future town and pleasure
resort of Piriapolis is to be situated. Some considerable
start in this direction has already been made, as
will be evident when it is explained that a great hotel
has already been constructed, and is now complete,
and ready for the day when it shall be officially
opened. The place is of quite a palatial order,
and is provided with no less than 120 bedrooms,
as well as with a magnificent dining-room and
very spacious apartments and lounges. A broad
terrace runs the entire length of the building on the
seaward side, and the tide, when at its highest, reaches
to within twenty yards of the hotel itself. A very
useful addition to the place is a large vegetable and
fruit garden that holds everything of the kind that
is needed. The plants and trees flourish amazingly
well here, although, curiously enough, their roots are
planted in no more satisfying a soil than sand.</p>

<p>The enterprise, however, has not contented itself
with the erection of the hotel. In the neighbourhood
of this building is a small casino, destined to be
employed for the purpose of games of chance, and
almost the entire margin of the bay is dotted by
little, square, four-roomed châlets. At some distance
from the hotel a stone mole is in the course of construction,
and it is here, of course, that the pleasure
steamers will land their passengers when the place
is once in the full swing of its active life.</p>

<p>At present the place stands empty&mdash;a prepared
shell awaiting this influx. As a feat of private
enterprise Piriapolis must take a high rank; for
the difficulties of transport have added vastly to the
labour of the undertaking. It is a beautiful spot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
in any case, and the pleasure resort should meet with
all the success it deserves.</p>

<p>The topic of Piriapolis brings us to the question of
afforestation. On this portion of the coast the science
is undoubtedly one of supreme importance, and one
to which of late years a fitting amount of attention
has been paid. The Government of Uruguay has
very wisely done much towards the encouragement of
tree-planting and the transformation of apparently
arid areas to regions of genuine fertility.</p>

<p>As an instance of this liberal and progressive policy
it may be mentioned that in 1909 Mr. Henry Burnett,
the British Vice-Consul at Maldonado, was awarded
a gold medal and a bonus of three thousand dollars
for having been the first to plant a collection of
over ten thousand maritime pines. The labour in the
first instance of inducing these young trees to grow
was arduous, and time after time the budding plantation
was buried beneath the masses of driven sand.
With the eventual survival, however, of the first screen
the remainder of the task proved easy, and Mr.
Burnett has now in his possession over one hundred
thousand maritime pines.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this example, numerous other landholders
of the district have succeeded in cultivating
similar plantations, and the result has proved highly
beneficial, not only in the transformation of the
country but from the commercial point of view as
well. For districts that until recently were absolutely
worthless are now valued at anything from ten
dollars to forty dollars the hectare.</p>

<p>A peculiar characteristic of these Maldonado sand-dunes
is to be met with in the fulgurites that are
found there&mdash;the vitrified sand-tubes caused by the
action of lightning that are referred to by Darwin
on the occasion of his visit to the spot. Similar
phenomena obtain in a few other corners of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
world, but those found here are by far the largest
in size, some extending to no less than five feet in
length. Owing, however, to their extremely fragile
nature, it is impossible to extract these larger
specimens in any fashion but in comparatively small
fragments.</p>

<p>Mr. C. E. R. Rowland, the British Vice-Consul at
Montevideo, has taken especial interest in these
fulgurites of the Maldonado Sands. The British
Museum contains some very fine specimens sent by
him, and he has supplied the national museum at
Montevideo with its first specimens of these
curiosities. This same gentleman, by the way, quite
recently discovered two distinct species of Uruguayan
lizards that, sent for classification to the South
Kensington Natural History Museum, were discovered
to be of kinds that until then had been
perfectly unknown. They remain in the museum to
which they were sent, dignified by the name of their
discoverer.</p>

<p>The railway journey from Montevideo to the town
of Mercedes, on the Rio Negro, is of ten hours'
duration. The first portion of the run is, of course,
through the pleasant suburbs of the capital that have
already been sufficiently described. At Juanico, some
forty kilometres distant from the starting-point, the
denser plantations and orchards have already fallen
away, and the country has definitely assumed its
natural grazing character, broken into here and there
by large areas of alfalfa. The place, as a matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of fact, is an important dairy centre, from which
Montevideo obtains a considerable proportion of its
butter, milk, and cheese.</p>

<p>Santa Lucia, the next halt, is another of those
smiling Oriental towns embowered in gardens and
orchards, and surrounded by tree-dotted pastures.
Close to the confines of the town runs the Santa
Lucia River, with its banks thickly bordered by
willows and poplars that at one point give way to
a wide avenue of the popular and gigantic eucalyptus.
The spot is much patronised in the summer for the
purpose of picnics; for&mdash;to his credit be it said&mdash;the
Uruguayan is a great connoisseur of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">al fresco</i>
and its charms.</p>

<p>On leaving Santa Lucia the railway line makes a
sweeping bend, and then crosses the river by an
iron bridge that proudly claims the distinction of
being the longest on the system. Upon the farther
side of the stream the country is brightened by the
innumerable blossom sprays of the many wild quince-trees,
and by the broad clumps of glowing gorse.
Soon, however, the aspect of the landscape alters
again, and the train is speeding once more through
the open Campo of pasture-land and of wheat and
barley fields.</p>

<p>San José, the next town of importance to be
reached, is remarkable as being the terminus of a
splendid macadamised road that runs a distance of
ninety-six kilometres from Montevideo to this point.
This excellent highway is constructed in a really
imposing fashion, and is engineered with a lordly
disregard of all obstacles. Just before reaching San
José, for instance, it crosses the river in the neighbourhood
of the town by a magnificent bridge no
less than 360 metres in length. This work was
commenced by an Uruguayan engineer in 1906, and
was completed in 1909, at a cost of nearly two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
hundred thousand gold dollars. The Uruguayans
take a vast amount of very just pride in this
structure, which is probably one of the finest road
bridges in existence. It forms a fitting conclusion,
moreover, to the best road in lower South America.</p>

<p>The town of San José itself is fairly important
from the point of view of population, since it numbers
thirteen thousand inhabitants&mdash;a fact that places it
in the first rank of the country towns of the Republic.
Its chief church dominates all the remaining buildings,
and affords a notable landmark for many miles
around. With the exception of this, San José contains
little of interest. It is, in fact, merely a typical
"camp" town that serves the surrounding agricultural
area. A most up-to-date mill that turns out
daily twenty-one tons of flour is, however, worthy
of remark, since from the moment that the wheat
is dumped into the granary to that when it emerges
as fine flour and is mechanically poured into sacks,
the whole process is effected by machinery.</p>

<p>Beyond San José the line climbs gradually to the
summit of a small sierra, whence a spreading
panorama of the surrounding country is obtained. On
leaving Mal Abrigo, the next station, the character
of the landscape alters. The rich, black, vegetable
soil has given way to a rocky surface. Huge
boulders of all shapes are strewn everywhere as
though flung by some giant upheaval into their
tremendous confusion. In the intervals of these
great rocks grow thorny trees and shrubs. Indeed,
this Sierra de Mal Abrigo differs from anything that
has gone before. Hares abound in the neighbourhood,
and at the approach of the train great numbers
of the animals speed away behind the sheltering
boulders. The armadillo, too, is especially plentiful
in this region, which seems to favour the partridge
and martineta almost equally well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Bizcocho is the last point of call before reaching
Mercedes, from which it is distant some twenty
kilometres. From here the ground&mdash;once again an
open, treeless plain&mdash;slopes continuously as it
descends towards the valley at the Rio Negro.
At the near approach to Mercedes itself the country
assumes the smiling aspect that seems the inevitable
attribute of the environs of the Uruguayan towns.
Gardens, orchards, streams, plantations, vineyards&mdash;all
these flit past in rapid sequence, until the train
pulls up at Mercedes station, the terminus of the
line.</p>

<p>This terminus of the line is well defined in more
senses than one. The station is situated on a bluff
that hangs immediately over the Rio Negro. It is
merely necessary to proceed to the end of the rails,
just beyond the platform, in order to look sheer down
upon the water of the river some hundred feet below.
A thoughtful act on the part of the railway company
to halt on the very brink, and thus to supply a
panorama in the place where the rails can no longer
travel!</p>

<p class="etc">

</p>

</div>

<p>As a town Mercedes is attractive to a degree.
The place can boast of no great size, it is true,
since its population does not exceed ten thousand.
Yet it is exceptionally fortunate both in its situation
and in the style of its buildings. The main portion
of the city consists of some half-dozen streets running
parallel to the river, crossed by a rather greater
number of thoroughfares that lead directly from the
water's edge. The houses are almost without exception
of the older style of architecture&mdash;rather low,
spreading buildings, each of which encloses one of
those charming patios that, alas! are now growing
steadily fewer with each year. Surely nothing is
more delightful than this verdure-filled courtyard set
in the midst of the house&mdash;the small stone-bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
garden with its flowers, shrubs, and palms, on to
which give all the lower rooms of the establishment!
They would doubtless continue to exist for centuries
were it not for the growing power and insistence of
their chief enemy, economy of space!</p>

<p>The streets and plazas of Mercedes are fairly
animated, for the town is the centre of considerable
social life. The majority of folk here are of rather
darker complexion than those of the capital, but
the women are almost equally good-looking. <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Coches</i>
are plentiful in the town; each of the two-horsed
buggies will seat six people with ease, and even then
will speed along at an exhilarating pace, for the
steeds of these public conveyances are both willing
and well cared for.</p>

<p>The highest point of the town is occupied by the
hospital. This, like so many other Uruguayan institutions
of the kind, is a very fine establishment, well
appointed, and provided with large, airy rooms and
corridors. From the roof of this hospital is revealed
a magnificent view of the town and its surroundings.
The entire panorama is one not easily to be forgotten.
So far as the river itself is concerned, it is possible
from this point of vantage to follow its windings
for miles in both directions. The river here, by
the way, attains to very nearly a quarter of a mile
in width&mdash;no despicable stretch of water even for a
tributary of the mighty Uruguay.</p>

<p>In mid-stream just opposite Mercedes is an island&mdash;a
gem of an island embowered in luxurious vegetation,
and completely fringed by large weeping
willows, whose drooping festoons of green all but
touch the waters. In conformity with the utilitarian
spirit of the age, a scheme is on foot for the construction
of an hotel in this place, and surely no
more alluring spot could be lit upon for the purpose&mdash;although
the danger to the landscape from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
erection of an unsuitable building would be very
real.</p>

<p>Between this island and the buildings of the town
is the port. Here the topsail schooners and the
various river craft of all descriptions lie at anchor,
including the small stern-wheel steamers that serve
for the passenger traffic into the far interior of the
land, and a few large barges piled high with the
bones of cattle. Jutting out into the stream near
here is a small mole, from which point a small motor-ferry
is wont to ply to and fro, and thus give connection
with the Fray Bentos road upon the opposite
shore. Just to the left of this, anchored in mid-river,
lies a large houseboat, which serves as the
headquarters of the local rowing and swimming clubs.</p>

<p>It is, of course, in this neighbourhood that the
river life is at its busiest. Upon the rocky shore
are groups of women in bright-coloured dresses busily
employed in washing household linen and various
garments&mdash;a sight, as a matter of fact, that may
be anticipated with certainty upon any populous
Oriental river bank. The motor-ferry, too, has by
no means the monopoly of transit, and numerous
smaller craft are continually passing from one
shore to the other. Their occupants are not necessarily
limited to the human species. Here, for
instance, is a horse being brought across in a small
rowing boat. The animal appears quite unconcerned;
he is doubtless accustomed to the aquatic
excursions in so tiny a skiff.</p>

<p>Returning from the riverside, a peculiar characteristic
of the Mercedes streets should attract the
eye, or, failing this, stumblings will ensue of a
certainty. On either side of the roadway is an
immense gutter of over a yard in depth and width.
These portentous channels serve to carry off the
rainfall of the heavy storms that occur from time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
to time, and on a dark night constitute formidable
obstacles in the path of an unwary foot-passenger.</p>

<p>Mercedes possesses a fairly important <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">saladero</i>,
and, in addition, constitutes a centre of the charcoal-burning
industry. A couple of hundred tons of this
commodity is frequently shipped from the place in
the course of a month. So far as hotels are concerned,
the Comercio is distinctly to be recommended.
The establishment is well above the average of those
that the ordinary provincial town can boast, being
clean, airy, and comfortable, and provided, moreover,
with a very genial host.</p>

<p>Colonia Suiza is situated, some twenty miles inland
from the coast, midway between Mercedes and Montevideo.
In order to reach this very picturesque
spot from the former town by rail it is necessary
to hark back to Mal Abrigo, from which junction
the run to the Swiss Colony is a short one. The
country through which the journey is made is of
the usual grazing order, sparsely populated, the
ground being marked only here and there by a typical
Uruguayan rancho.</p>

<p>The modest establishments of this particular
district are worthy of special mention. Each is contrived
from square blocks of turf, carefully cut, and
placed one on top of the other with the grass edge
downwards. The exterior of the walls is left without
any attempt at facing or adornment, and thus
presents a distinctly crude and peculiar appearance.
The dwelling, however, is rendered snug and waterproof
by being plastered from within. These walls
are extremely well made, considering the fact that
their composition is not assisted by any additional
material. The roof is made of wood, cut in lengths,
and thatched over with wood or straw.</p>

<p>Household removals on the Uruguayan campo are
not necessarily matters of weighty thought, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
occurrence is to be anticipated with dread for many
months beforehand. When the family who owns one
of these mud ranches decides to move, the procedure
is very simple. The roof, doors, and windows of
the home are taken down and collected. After which
it is merely necessary for the party to pack these
along with them on horseback, until a suitable site
is lit upon for a new erection of turf into which
the portable finishing touches may be inserted. That
effected, the owners are once more at home. As
for the discarded dwelling, it remains much as before,
save that it is minus roof, door, and windows.</p>

<p>Many of these skeleton huts are to be met with
on the rolling face of the country. They possess
this in common with birds' nests, that from a distance
it is difficult to ascertain whether they are occupied
or to let. If deserted, there is no reason why any
chance family on the move should not take possession
by no more formal means than that of affixing
roof, door, and windows in the gaps that await them.
Many of these ranchos, by the way, are surrounded
by very pretty gardens, and hedged in by tall hedges
of geranium and rose.</p>

<p>Once arrived at the Swiss Colony, however, the
aspect of the dwellings becomes altogether changed.
The houses here resemble strongly the châlets of
the Swiss mountains, for, like the remaining colonies
of the kind throughout the River Plate republics,
the immigrants have introduced their own ways and
fashions of living. Indeed, the existence of such
bodies provides an ample testimonial of the conditions
of freedom under which life is conducted
in these countries.</p>

<p>The number and strange variety of these self-contained
colonies in this part of the world is
scarcely realised. They are, of course, totally distinct
from the ordinary, scattered immigrant dwellers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
When surveyed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i> the result is not a little
extraordinary. In the three Spanish-speaking republics
of Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay that,
together with Southern Bolivia, formed the old River
Plate provinces, exist distinct and important settlements
of Swiss, Austrians, Poles, Australians, Welsh,
Boers, and Jews, besides numerous lesser groups of
many nationalities beyond.</p>

<p>Within the frontiers of each perfect liberty obtains
to continue existence as it is led in the country
from which the immigrants came, and thus each is
provided with its own churches and institutions. In
the case of the more recently founded it is almost
as though a portion of the foreign land had been
translated bodily to South American soil, while those
of older standing have invariably yielded more or
less to the influence of their surroundings. But the
choice of remaining entirely aloof, or of assimilating
the customs that prevail outside their own frontiers
lies entirely in the hands of the immigrant communities.
It is, of course, only natural that each
section should carry on that particular branch of
industry to which it has been accustomed in its
country of origin.</p>

<p>The Colonia Suiza constitutes an important body,
containing, as it does, no less than four thousand
inhabitants. Here it is not surprising that the staple
industry should be that of cheese manufacture and
dairy produce. In addition to this a fair amount
of agriculture is carried on. The soil of the district
is well adapted to linseed, and numerous vineyards
are responsible for the production of a local wine
of very fair quality.</p>

<p>Consisting for the most part of small dairy farms,
no regular township exists in the colony, although
a small village has sprung into being in the neighbourhood
of the railway station, and three hotels are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
distributed at wide intervals across the area occupied.
The community, first established in 1862 by
the arrival of seven Swiss families, is flourishing,
and its members have clung to their national habits
with more tenacity than is usual.</p>

<p>The largest and most important butter factory in
the place produces in the springtime a daily quantity
of no less than a ton of butter. Its proprietor,
ere he emigrated, played the rôle of a small shopkeeper
in his own country. His house was burned
to the ground, but, fortunately for himself, the
property was insured. He employed the money derived
from this source for the purpose of the voyage
to South America, and, arrived at the Colonia Suiza,
he found employment in the carrying round of the
milk. In a very short while he was employing others
to perform this service for himself, and is now a
wealthy man, thus affording one more example of
those rapid rises from poverty to riches that are
so characteristic of South America.</p>

<p>The general aspects of this colony are peculiarly
agreeable. Situated in one of the most pleasant
districts of a smiling land, it is well watered and
timbered. The verdure of the place, moreover, is
enhanced by the numerous green lanes that intersect
it. Indeed, no more delightful situation could be
imagined than that occupied by many of the châlets
of Swiss design.</p>

<p>The small town of Colonia stands quite alone in
many respects. Not as regards situation, climate,
and a reputation as a pleasure resort. In all these
three the spot is especially favoured; yet in each
of these it possesses a number of formidable rivals
along the Uruguayan coast. Excursionists flock to
Colonia, it is true, but such flighty nomads are more
concerned with beaches and bathing than with the
subtler and deeper interests of the spot.</p>

<p>To the historian and to the antiquarian Colonia
represents a gem. It must be admitted that the
values of such treasures go strictly by comparison.
Uruguay is rich in the amethyst and topaz, but poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
in architectural ruins. Indeed, these romantic
features are distressingly&mdash;or pleasingly&mdash;rare
throughout all the lands that made up the
provinces of the old River Plate. So far as I
am aware, almost the sole examples of any real
antiquity are to be met with in the Jesuit ruins of
Paraguay and the Misiones Province, and in the few
fragmentary Inca relics upon the Andes slopes.
Beyond these there is Colonia. Therefore if the
gem lack the full brilliance of some of the specimens
that an older continent can produce, its importance
must not be under-estimated, since it possesses the
rare merit of being all but unique in its own country.</p>

<p>From the Uruguayan bank of the great river
Colonia faces Buenos Aires. The one is not visible
from the other, since almost forty miles separate
the two cities&mdash;a distance that has frequently been
found too short for the peace of mind of both.
For, although they now sit on their respective banks
in undisturbed peace, the past has only too many
instances to show of how the pair opposed each
other with an active hostility that worked its share
in the building up of the warlike history of Colonia.</p>

<p>The present fate of Colonia is much akin to that
of many of those spots that serve as the decayed
shells of old-time battles and terrific alarums. In
short, it is a sleepy hollow. There are certainly
times when a large river steamer comes to rest for
a while against its wooden jetty, and disgorges a
crowd of tourists who wander aimlessly about the
quaint streets. But such spells are short, since the
interests of the spot can compare in the minds of
very few of such visitors with the great bullring
and pelota-court, recently erected some half-dozen
miles up-stream, to which they are on their way.
Thus the place has barely time to shake its old
walls, and yawn with its blank windows, wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
at this sudden new life that has sprung up within
it, when the spasm has passed away, and Colonia
sinks back from its semi-conscious state into full
slumber again.</p>

<p>The first impressions of the old town, when viewed
from the river, present a rather strange medley of
brown, yellow, grey, white, pink, and green. Thrown
together as abruptly as this, the colour scheme doubtless
sounds perplexing. Yet in reality the tints
blend with consummate harmony. The brown is
rendered by the rocks that hem in the little bays
and inlets of the foreground, while the lichen that
clings to the stone accounts for a strangely brilliant
yellow. The grey is produced by the most important
asset of the town, the ruined walls and battlements
of the fortifications that pile themselves sullenly upon
the rocks along the river bank, penetrating the waters
at many points. The pink and white gleam very
softly from the more modern houses in the background
that mingle with the old, crumbling erections
of grey, while at close intervals the verdure
of trees and shrubs sprouts out thickly from amongst
the masonry. To conclude with all this colour, so
far as possible at one fell swoop, the town is dominated
by a brilliant white lighthouse shaft and the
twin red towers of a modern church.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly one of the most curious effects for
which Colonia is responsible is that of its compactness.
There is scarcely a town in Uruguay, or in
Argentina either, whose outskirts do not straggle far
away from the centre into the Campo. To one who
has inevitably become accustomed to these architectural
loose-ends the accurately defined boundaries
of the riverside town are not a little striking. The
reason is a very simple one. In the old days the
city of discord was completely surrounded by fortifications
and, since it has performed the feat&mdash;almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
unique in the country&mdash;of failing to grow in extent
since that time, its original abrupt boundaries have
remained. The result, from an artistic point of view,
is undoubtedly far more imposing than that produced
by the stress of modern development.</p>

<p>Colonia is not a town to be skimmed over lightly.
It is worthy of almost as careful a reconnoitring as
it has frequently suffered in the past. For the place
can boast of half a dozen regular sieges, and pitched
battles, sallies, and skirmishes galore. Indians and
Spaniards, Spaniards and Portuguese, Uruguayans
and Spaniards, Uruguayans and Portuguese&mdash;all
these have fought together here on countless
occasions, and yet the list of the warring companies
is not ended. The red ponchos of Urquiza's
Gauchos have charged up to the grey walls, staining
the brown earth crimson as they went; buccaneers
of all nations have come and gone, and the scarlet
of a British garrison has gleamed out against the
background of stone. Colonia is the reddest spot of
all in a sadly bloodstained land.</p>

<p>But, however much the aftermath of battles may
brood, the aspect of the place is as fair as could
be desired. Just opposite its site are the first green
islands of the river, the oceanward outposts of the
lengthy series that rest in the midst of the waters
upstream. This shore of the mainland itself is
picturesque in another fashion. Bright semicircles
and crescents of sand fringe the rocks of the innumerable
small bays. Upon the natural boulders,
and ledges, and heaps of masonry above are clusters
of green leaves starred with blossoms. Here and
there a growth of more artificial kind is spread upon
the stone; for the sole figures upon the foreshore
are those of two washerwomen, busily engaged
amongst the pools, whose variegated harvest is
increasing in area as it is spread out to dry.</p>

</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>In places the surface of the old masonry is level
and wide; in others it is necessary to leap from
point to point just as it is in the case of the rocks
below. Scrambling and walking thus for several
hundred yards, the way lies past a collection of
ruined houses, the massive walls of which prick
upwards in gaunt desolation. Beyond these again
is a narrow passage, paved principally by the chance
falling of the masonry, that leads into one of the
actual streets of the town.</p>

<p>The medley here is fascinating from the mere
force of its quaintness. The first houses that flank
the slender thoroughfare as it winds its way uphill
are a few pink erections, fairly modern, with windows
plainly barred, and open doorways, through which is
visible the foliage that decorates the patio within.
Side by side with these is a building of quite another
type, an old grey house, stately and imposing, though
now little beyond a shell of ruins. Its front is thickly
set with the remnants of graceful balconies, and with
broken shields and coats of arms. Upon the massive
doorway is an ancient bronze knocker in the form
of a human hand. But the hapless instrument has
been silent now for many a generation, since at the
back of the doorway itself is nothing beyond a confusion
of tumbled stone into whose crevices the roots
of the intruding shrubs and flowers have pressed
themselves.</p>

<p>The street is quite deserted; the temptation to
raise the bronze hand and bang out the echoes is
almost irresistible. It is certain that one could arouse
nothing beyond the ghosts of the past. Yet the
answer to such an appeal might prove a little too
intense for the modern tranquillity of mind. Confined
to the days of peace, the vision would be well enough.
The house, the walls, the patio, the fretwork of the
balconies, the carving of the coats of arms&mdash;all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
would be intact and hung about with humanity. In
obedience to the most commonplace demands of the
all-pervading romance, breeched men, whose long-draped
cloaks hid the lace and buckles of their
costume, would send out their voices and the tinklings
of their guitars towards the señoritas, whose soft
eyes glowed beneath a tremendous headgear, and
who wore their filmy wrappings and short skirts with
true Iberian grace.</p>

<p>Within the courtyard the negro slaves would
lounge at their ease, while near them would repose
the great guardian dogs of the house. Now and
again would sound a heavy rumble from the street
without that signified the advent of visitors in a
cumbrous coach of state&mdash;an interruption that would
still the notes of voice and guitar string, and that
would excite the negro attendants into sudden life
and the dogs into a delirium of barking. After
which many grave bows and deep curtseyings would
prelude the quiet ceremony of entertainment.</p>

<p>But if instead of this peaceful scene the wrong
half of the past were to appear! For there were
times when the heavy booming and uproar drew ever
nearer from without, and then the faces of the
señoritas as they peered through the elaborate bars
were ashy pale. There were moments, too, when
the last doubts had turned to a bitter certainty, when
the forms of fleeing men passed the house, and those
of others, who stayed, reddened the ground before the
door. And last of all!&mdash;the apparition of the strange
men in hostile garb, the lust of slaughter in their
eyes as they rushed on, making another place of the
once familiar street. Thirsting for blood, hungry
for booty, and for all things beyond&mdash;the cheeks of
the shuddering señoritas have not paled without
reason. After all, perhaps it is better to leave
undisturbed the knocker upon the old door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>Such mental apparitions, moreover, could be
multiplied indefinitely, for there are a dozen houses
of similar design, if of varied ruinous importance, in
the town. Indeed, the place breathes strongly of
the past. At a street corner here and there is an
ancient cannon, buried muzzle upwards into the
ground, that serves to fend off from the sidewalk
such wheeled traffic as exists. After a while the
narrow street falls away, and the wide sweep of the
plaza extends to the front.</p>

<p>The place was once the site of a rather peculiar
feat of frontier delimitation. The occasion was that
of one of the numerous cessions by treaty to Portugal
of the town that the Spaniards were wont to win by
force of arms. On receiving the order from the Court
of Spain to evacuate the province in favour of the
temporarily reconciled enemy the staunch old Spanish
Governor lost patience. The town, he knew full
well, he must surrender, but he refused to give up
more even at the command of his royal master. So
he raised the muzzle of a cannon in the plaza, fired
a shot to right and left, and told the Portuguese
that the land within the range of the balls was theirs,
but no more. And with this they had to be content.</p>

<p>There are now no cannon in the plaza, where,
indeed, the wild shrubs and grasses alone thrive.
Passing across it, the river is approached again, for
Colonia covers a small promontory. Ere reaching
the water on the farther side, however, it is necessary
to pass by far the most imposing ruin in the
place. By the side of the white lighthouse tower
a tall fragment of grey fortress wall rears itself
aloft. Some four feet thick throughout, its crumbling
embrasures are strongly lit up by the blue sky
behind.</p>

<p>From this point the ground slopes abruptly downwards
towards the shore. Here are more rocks, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
mounds of ruined masonry, more washerwomen&mdash;and
the forms of a girl and of a man seated apart
from the rest upon the stones. The girl is flaming
in all the pride of red skirt and kerchief and yellow
blouse. For all I know the latter garment may
not technically be admissible within the strict category
of blouses, but, failing a more intimate knowledge,
it must pass as something similar! By
comparison with the very brilliant butterfly, the man
looms a dusky moth, whose only glitter lies in the
great, round, silver spurs that protrude from his
high heels. Yet the business of the pair is the same
as ever! Though wrought out more frequently when
Colonia really lived, it obtains still amongst the
ruins. It is comforting to reflect that even the most
simple of these rural chains of the affections continues
with links far less unbroken than those
of war!</p>

<p>Some three miles distant from Colonia, and
situated likewise upon the banks of the river, is Real
de San Carlo. Although such close neighbours, it
would be difficult to find two spots that differed more
widely from each other. Real de San Carlo is a
mushroom of a place that has only known existence
for some two or three years. Since it is planned
as a pleasure resort pure and simple, the nature of
Real de San Carlo is to a certain extent artificial,
and the brand-new buildings have yet to be toned
down by the softening process of age.</p>

<p>So far the new bathing-place is deficient in the
private dwelling-houses and châlets that characterise
the majority of such spots. On the arrival of the
steamer at the imposing pier, the eye is arrested at
once by the sight of two very large buildings, and
by that of one of a more moderate size. Beyond
these there is little in the way of architectural development,
with the insignificant exception of the
cottages that house the labourers upon the place.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 700px;"><a name="bull" id="bull"></a>

<p class="etc">
To face p. 222.
</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the two great buildings the bullring is the
more notable. Indeed, the enormous circular erection
of white concrete is visible for a distance of many
miles in all directions. One side of the ground
beneath, sheltered by the rising spread of tiers that
hold the seats, is occupied by an open-air café, while
the appointments within are of the usual order to
be met with in bullrings. It is here that the
periodical bullfights are held, and it is here, moreover,
that many of the noted Spanish fighters
perform.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of the bullring is the pelota-court,
which is only just now being completed, in
which the famous Basque game is to be played.
This is likewise constructed of white concrete, and,
although its magnitude cannot rival that of the bullring,
it is of an amazing size for a building of the
kind, holding galleries above, as it does, that must
be capable of seating several thousand spectators.
Compared with these two tremendous affairs, the hotel
is of modest dimensions and of unpretentious appearance.
Nevertheless, were it to stand apart from
such overwhelming neighbours, it would doubtless
appear imposing enough.</p>

<p>Real de San Carlo is well equipped to cope with
the crowds of visitors that the steamers already bring
to its shore; it does things, in fact, in a certain
elaborate style of its own. A narrow-gauge steam
tramway runs between the jetty and the bullring,
although the distance does not exceed a quarter of
a mile, and behind the miniature engine a number
of cars are in waiting, each containing a row of
seats facing outwards on either side. At the
moment of the visit the bull-fighting itself is undergoing
a temporary lull&mdash;a fact that, from one's own
point of view, is very little to be regretted. So
the tramcars, crowded now, roll merrily onwards to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
a ring devoid of espadas, bulls, horses, and blood,
and for the majority of the tourists the chief business
of the day is confined to the precincts of the
café in the shade of the great building.</p>

<p>Apart from these more artificial attractions, Real
de San Carlo will undoubtedly prove popular as a
bathing resort. The fine white sands and rippling
waters here possess an invaluable auxiliary in the
delightful air with which the place is blessed. In
this springtime of the year, moreover, the sands themselves
are decorated in rather an unusual fashion.
From them sprout masses of silver-white, thick, silky
leaves, and stems that support blossoms that exactly
resemble small sunflowers. The effect that the great
stretches of these present is distinctly striking.
Thickly spangling the white sand is a silver glow,
topped by the yellow of the blossoms above&mdash;a colour
scheme that gives a strangely fairylike and unreal
impression. As though to lend a touch of warmer
colour, thousands of butterflies, all of a variety of
the painted-lady species, are hovering in clouds about
the blossoms.</p>

<p>Just inland, where the undulations of the real
country begin, the lanes are ablaze with passionflower
and honeysuckle&mdash;but the steamer is whistling
impatiently in the distance, and the tourists are flocking
back to the tramcars. It is time to return, and
to mingle with the crowd once more, the great
majority of which are returning to Buenos Aires.
For it is on the inhabitants of this city, within a
couple of hours' steam across the river, that Real
de San Carlo depends for its popularity, and consequent
welfare.</p>

<p>As a waterway the Uruguay River is of infinite
service to the Republic whose western coastline it
serves. It is true that, compared with the Paraná,
the stream suffers somewhat both as regards length
and navigable facilities. Both rivers have much in
common, in that either has its source in the mountain
ranges that fringe the coast of Brazil, and either
flows first to the west, then southwards until the
junction of the pair forms the broad River Plate.
But, whereas the Paraná rises in latitude 22° south
the first waters of the Uruguay do not come into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
being until 28° south. The latter, in consequence,
has to content itself with a course of a thousand
miles, rather less than half the length of its neighbour.</p>

<p>The lower stretch of the Uruguay holds an obstacle
to navigation that is unknown in the corresponding
waters of the Paraná. At Salto, some two hundred
miles above the mouth, falls extend from the one
bank to the other, and thus bar the passage of all
vessels. Above this place, however, is the starting-point
for the lighter draught steamers that continue
their northward course for many hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>As though to compensate for the barrier, the first
two hundred miles of the Uruguay represent a particularly
noble highway of waters, far broader and
more imposing, indeed, than the equivalent stretch of
the Paraná. Ocean-going vessels here penetrate to
Paysandú, and beyond it to the Lemco port of Colón
on the Argentine shore, while the really magnificent
steamers of the River King, Mihanovich, produce
their finest specimens to ply to and fro here. But,
as the banks of the stream contain not only some of
the most fertile lands in the Republic but much of
interest beyond, it is worth while to follow its course,
beginning at Montevideo itself, which, as a matter
of fact, is somewhat to anticipate the waters of the
true Uruguay.</p>

<p>By the quayside of the capital are grouped three
or four of the Mihanovich craft, large, two-funnelled
vessels with an imposing array of decks surmounted
by an unusually spacious promenade that crowns the
whole. One of these is bound for Salto&mdash;or rather
for the Argentine town of Concordia that lies opposite
that port&mdash;but just now it is not advisable to be tied
hard and fast to her broad decks, since she must call
at Buenos Aires on her way, and at many other spots
outside Uruguay and the scope of this book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>We will therefore perform the strange feat of
making a break in the trip ere it is begun. In any
case it is necessary to leave the quay over whose
broad, paved surface of reclaimed land the cabs
are rattling, and where the policeman and porters
stand, and where, moreover, a strong group of Salvationists
are singing lustily, surrounded by a motley
but attentive group such as the precincts of a port
attract. But the graceful <em>Triton</em> shall churn her way
out into the open without us, since we will cling so
far as possible to the Uruguayan shore, forging
upwards through the yellowing waters, to halt at
Sauce with its willow-covered lands and Colonia with
its rocky beach, until Carmelo is passed, and at
Nueva Palmira the River Uruguay has been fairly
entered. Even then, however, it is necessary to
accept the fact more or less on trust, and to confide
in the accuracy of the map rather than in that of
the eyesight. For the faint line that has recently
appeared on the horizon to the left might as well
stand for a distant streak upon the waters as for the
low-lying Argentine shore that it actually represents.</p>

<p>To the right, the Uruguayan bank is well defined.
Here the undulations of the land swell boldly out
from the edge of the river, while in many places
rocks and boulders strew the sloping foreshore as
though to accentuate the frontier between stream
and land that is so faintly defined upon the opposite
coast. Here and there the verdure of the hills is
broken by the darker green bands of the eucalyptus
plantations, through which from time to time gleam
the white walls of an estancia-house. At intervals
the chimneys of a saladero prick upwards from the
nearer neighbourhood of the bank. About these
centres of their doom the speck-like figures of the
cattle dot the surrounding pastures, grazing in
fortunate ignorance of their end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The traffic upon the river itself is by no means
inconsiderable. Native topsail schooners laden with
jerked beef, fruit, and timber come gliding serenely
down the stream beneath their spread of sail. One
of these craft is especially indicative of the main
industry of the land. The vessel is laden as high as
the booms will permit with horns of cattle, the
bleaching mounds of which must represent the
sacrifice of many thousands of animals. There are
smart Government tugs, too, that hold the official
guardians of the mighty stream, and great dredgers
of queer and monstrous shape that steam slowly
along to find an anchorage where the bottom is
shallow, and there remorselessly to bite out mouthfuls
from the unduly lofty bed.</p>

<p>At rarer intervals appear the ocean-going craft
and sailing vessels. It would be safe to wager that
there is not one of those passing down-stream that
is not laden with some portions or other of the bodies
bequeathed to humanity by the unconsulted yet
generous bovine souls. Nevertheless the exact
species of cargo would be more difficult to predict.
It might be beef itself, or hides that will make
leather upon which to sit while consuming the meat,
or horns which will provide handles for the necessary
complement of knives, or indeed many other
products useful for similar purposes. There never
was such a creature as the ox for the provision of a
variety of articles that all eloquently urge the benefit
of his death!</p>

<p>A tall and majestic structure has come into sight
from round a bend in the stream now, and is sweeping
rapidly downwards. With grey hull, white upper-works
about her rows of decks, and twin black
funnels to cap the whole, she is one of the proud
fleet of steamers that ply throughout the entire system
of the great rivers. If the vessel upon which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
may be found bears a corresponding <strong>M</strong> upon its
funnel&mdash;which in the case of a passenger craft may
be taken as a practical certainty&mdash;you may be assured
that you will not be passed without recognition, even
if sheltered by a mere paltry stern-wheeler that
is bound for one of the small tributary streams.
Combining affability with size, the whale will blow
out three deep roars of salute from its great horn,
that will be echoed by a like number of shrill notes
from the treble whistle of the minnow. Such is the
etiquette throughout the entire length of the rivers.
The six blows are sounding throughout the day from
the tropics of Brazil downwards to where the La
Plata and the ocean meet.</p>

<p>Upon the right-hand side Fray Bentos has come
into view, marked in the first place by a great
collection of tall black chimneys glistening in the
sun. Beneath is verdure, and massive white buildings,
and streets of dwelling-houses, while to the
front is the Lemco port with a small forest of masts
rising from its waters. The place, in a double
sense, represents the very incarnation of Uruguay's
trade. A greedy spot that swallows live cattle by
tens of thousands to render them up again in the
pathetically diminished form of extract! Even now
the odour of soup floats heavily in the air from across
a mile of water&mdash;a proof that Fray Bentos is busily
occupied in turning out its brown rivers of fluid.</p>

<p>The factory, the most notable in the country, is
indeed strongly symbolical of the land where starvation
in ordinary circumstances of peace has never
yet been known. Havana may be the paradise of the
smoker, Epernay that of the champagne lover; but
the eater's heaven is undoubtedly situated in Uruguay,
a paradise in which the spirits of departed and honest
butchers might well revel in perfect joy.</p>

<p>Just above Fray Bentos the islands dot the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
more plentifully than in almost any other part of the
great stream. As is the case on the Paraná, it is
difficult enough at times to distinguish between these
and the true bank on the Argentine shore; both are
equally lowly and each covered with the same density
of willows and native scrub. Amongst these larger
islands, however, whose surface may comprise several
square miles, are numerous smaller pieces of land,
and some quite diminutive specimens that can lay
claim to no more than a few yards of area. These
are baby islands&mdash;young territories that have only just
succeeded in raising their heads above water. For
an island here is conceived, grows, and dies in a
fashion that is vegetable rather than purely earthy.
The fact is not really curious, seeing that vegetation
is directly concerned in their birth.</p>

<p>The conception of one of these is evident even now.
A tangle of the thick leaves of the camelota&mdash;the
water plant with its mauve hyacinth-like flower&mdash;has
in its downward floating course fouled the earth
of a shallow in mid-stream. The arrested clump of
green has already inveigled other objects to keep
it company in its trap. A few sticks and branches
and tufts of grass are already fast in the embrace
of the powerful stems and green leaves, while at
the end that faces the stream the water-driven sand
has risen at the obstacle, and has shyly protruded a
small round hump or two above the ripples. The
life of the thing is as uncertain as that of a seedling
or of a human child. Under favourable conditions
it will grow and solidify year by year until from the
few leaves and sticks will have extended some square
miles of tree-covered soil. On the other hand, it may
be swept remorselessly away in its earliest days ere
the tentative formation has had time to secure sufficiently
firm hold of the earth.</p>

<p>In any case the life of these islands is comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
short, and fresh floods and currents are forming some
and destroying others all the while. During these
periods of flood many of them would seem possessed
of the characteristics of icebergs. Detached by the
irresistible force of the currents, great fragments
of the vegetation and camelota plant that cling to
their sides go swirling down the stream. Though
they can boast no polar bears, they are occasionally
freighted with other beasts whose neighbourhood is
equally undesirable. On such occasions snakes and
many four-footed specimens of northern creatures
form the unwilling tenants of these frail rafts of
vegetation. It is said that many years ago one of
unusually large size struck the shore of Montevideo
itself, disgorging four jaguars, who entered the town
as much to their own terror as to that of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>With Fray Bentos once left in the rear, the river
becomes distinctly narrowed, and, where no islands
intervene, the features of either bank begin to be
clearly distinguished at the same time. The Argentine
shore has broken away from its dead level
now, and is rising in gentle undulations; the
Uruguayan coast, too, as though in a determined
endeavour to retain its physical superiority, has taken
to heap itself in far loftier and more imposing hills
than before.</p>

<p>The next town of importance at which the steamer
halts is that of Paysandú, the great centre of ox-tongues.
Indeed, were one to adopt the popular
figurative methods of certain magazines, amazing
results might well be extracted from the commerce
of the place. Thus, supposing a year's accumulation
of Paysandú ox-tongues were able jointly to give
forth the notes that they were wont to render in
life, the effect of the combined roar would probably
be to deafen the entire populace of the Republic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
and to blow every atom of water from the river!
The number of men they would feed, and the distance
they would cover if extended in a line I do not know;
but it may be taken for granted that the export
of these preserved instruments of bovine speech is
very considerable.</p>

<p>Paysandú ranks as the second commercial city in
the Republic. It is true that, so far as size is concerned,
it is altogether dwarfed by Montevideo, since
the inhabitants of the smaller town number only
twenty thousand or so. Yet, the centre of a rich
pastoral and agricultural province, the place is of
no little commercial importance, and, although its
architecture remains largely of the pleasant but old-fashioned
Spanish style, not a few new buildings and
boulevards have already sprung into existence. Like
the majority of towns of its kind, it is well equipped
with electric lighting, telephones, and other such
modern appliances, although its tramcar traction is
still effected by the humbler methods of the horse.</p>

<p>To the north of Paysandú the stream narrows, the
islands become few and far between, and the course
of the river is distinct and well-defined. The landscape,
too, is more varied now than that of the
lower reaches. Among the Uruguayan rounded hills
a few well-marked tablelands spread their broad,
level surfaces in the way that is characteristic of so
many parts of the Republic. Both the inland valleys
and river banks are covered with an added density
of vegetation, while beaches of shining white sand
jut out at intervals from the shore. As for the
Argentine bank, it has quite suddenly assumed a
marked individuality of its own. It is covered with
a reddish yellow rolling soil, tinged only lightly with
green, from which close groves of palm-trees sprout
upwards for mile after mile. It is as though a
portion of Africa on the one shore were facing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
rather wooded and broken portion of the South
Downs on the other!</p>

<p>The water itself has been growing more limpid
all the while, now that the dead-flat, soft, alluvial soil
of the Argentine bank has given way to a harder and
more stony surface. It has become shallow in parts,
too, and the nose of the steamer often gives a tentative
turn to the right or left as she cautiously feels her
way. The craft has penetrated almost to the limits
of the lower stretch of the great river now, and the
rising bed is a premonitory symptom of the end.</p>

<p>On the right has now risen the loftiest bluff that
has yet marked the Uruguayan shore. It forms one
of the walls of a striking and bold table-land. The
place is now known as the <em>Mesa de Artigas</em>&mdash;the
table of Artigas. It was upon the summit of this hill
that the Uruguayan national hero had his chief
encampment, and it has been described as a desolate
and lonely spot, haunted by murdered spirits and
by the memory of horrors, that no living being
cared to approach. The description cannot be said
to hold good at the present moment. The green
slopes are dotted with grazing cattle and sheep, while
at one point the distant figures of two mounted
Gauchos are careering to and fro, and the cattle in
the neighbourhood are wheeling together and lumbering
forward as a result of their manoeuvres.</p>

<p>On the summit of the tableland is a peculiarly
tall stone pedestal that rises from a great pyramidal
base to soar high upwards against the sky-line. The
shaft is surmounted by a bust that represents Artigas
himself. The entire structure is on the colossal side,
and the effect of the bust poised on high against
the blue of the air is curious rather than effective.
Viewing it from far below, it is difficult to avoid
the impression that the head and shoulders, placed
half-way between earth and heaven, are pleading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
with mute eloquence for a body and legs with which
to grasp more firmly the summit of the sustaining
shaft. In any case the monument is bold, and
affords a strikingly conspicuous landmark for an area
of many leagues.</p>

<p>To the north of the Mesa de Artigas the landscape
of the river continues bold and hilly. A score
or so of miles up-stream from the monument lies the
town of Salto, the last place of real importance upon
this stretch of the Uruguayan frontier. With its
buildings rising to cover the hills of its site, the panorama
of Salto is more imposing in its way than that
of any other town on the banks of the stream.
Indeed, piled on the summit of cliffs and bluffs, the
white masses of masonry, crowned by a few steeples
and towers, are visible from far inland upon the
Argentine territory as well as from the remoter neighbourhoods
of its own soil. The river just here is
exceptionally populous, since facing Salto from
across the waters is Concordia, a large and thriving
Argentine town.</p>

<p>The population of Salto is slightly in excess of
twenty thousand, and, like every other town along
the length of the stream, it serves as a storehouse
for the pastoral and agricultural industries of the
district. In many respects, however, the situation of
the town gives it a commercial scope greater than
that of the more southern towns. Although the
climate lacks sufficient heat for the production of
the banana and similar sub-tropical growths, the
variety of fruit is very great. The orange flourishes
in exceptional abundance here, and its cultivation
forms a valuable addition to the wealth of the
district.</p>

<p>Pleasantly situated, with shaded plazas and
avenues, and with the orchards, vineyards, orange-groves,
and well-timbered country of its outskirts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Salto lies at the end&mdash;or, to be more accurate, the
beginning&mdash;of the lower Uruguay. Just above the
town a white foaming line stretches from bank to
bank during the periods when the river is low. But
these lower falls are navigable during a considerable
portion of the year, and not until Salto Grande, at
a point considerably higher up, is the permanent
barrier to navigation reached. Between Salto itself
and Concordia the river is plentifully strewn with
rocks, and, although the channels are deep, it is
necessary on this head for vessels to use considerable
caution, more especially as the tide races fiercely just
here. Indeed, the fluctuations of the stream at this
point are very great, and account for the tremendously
lofty wooden passenger pier that serves the
town.</p>

<p>It is in the neighbourhood of Salto that is found
the curious water stone that is referred to elsewhere
in this book. It is in this province too that exist
the topaz and amethyst mines. The visitor, however,
need not trouble his head to start out upon any
expedition with the object of picking up any of
these curiosities. The topaz and amethyst fields are
well-defined private property, while the water-stone
is as shy and elusive as a four-leaved clover at
home. If in quest of these objects, it is wiser to
restrict the field of adventure to the Salto shops.</p>

<p>It has been noticeable all the time whilst ascending
the river that the water has steadily become less
tinged with yellow. Above the falls, however, the
distinction is far more marked. The stream here
is peculiarly limpid, and the effect at a northern spot
such as Santa Rosa, almost on the Brazilian frontier,
is entrancing. Here the river is at times of a brilliant
blue tint&mdash;a broad azure ribbon winding between
swelling banks covered now with dense folds of
vegetation. Viewed from the rising ground in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
neighbourhood, the conviction is inevitable that,
although the northern waters may have lost a little
in commercial importance, the Upper Uruguay can
lay claim to a degree of beauty with which the lower
reaches, for all their charm, cannot compete.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan Campo is not to be described
without a certain amount of hesitation. It would
be simple enough for one who had caught only a
distant passing glimpse of the land of the pastures to
put down the country without further ado as rolling
grass upland watered by many streams. That such
is the foundation of the Campo is undeniable. Nevertheless
to begin and end with such a phrase would
be equivalent to a description of the peacock as a
bird who wears coloured feathers.</p>

<p>The subtle charms of the Uruguayan Campo are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
not to be discerned through the medium of the
bioscope-like glimpses that so many travellers obtain
of it. Very rightly, it refuses to reveal itself fully
until a certain amount of familiarity has justified
a nearer acquaintance. From an æsthetic point of
view it certainly holds far more than might be
expected from a country of such comparatively
limited attributes.</p>

<p>If you desire to watch the moods of this rural
Banda Oriental, ride out to mount one of the higher
shoulders of the downland, and wait there, either
in the saddle or out of it. You will obtain little
sympathy in the task. Eccentric to the mind of
the estancieros, frankly mad in the eagle eyes of
the Gaucho&mdash;a calm survey of the Campo is worth all
such merely human depreciation!</p>

<p>The aspect of the country in the immediate neighbourhood
of where the observer has taken his stand
will be green in the main, although the unbroken
verdure by no means obtains throughout. Here and
there the ground is strongly marked by the occasional
heaps of stones that come jostling to the surface,
and that recline in the fashion of small bleak islands
in the midst of the green waves. But, should the
time be spring, these latter are themselves flecked
frequently almost to the extinction of their own
colouring. The great purple bands and patches of
the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">flor morala</i> lie thickly upon the land. These,
however, stand apart, since where they glow the
serried ranks of blossom permit no others to raise
their heads.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="caption">A PASTORAL SCENE.</span></p>

<p class="etc">
To face p. 238.
</p>

</div>

<p>But these, though the boldest of their kind, are
by no means the sole occupants of the landscape.
Indeed, one of the chief characteristics of the Banda
Oriental Campo is the wealth of beautiful and comparatively
lowly plants that grow amidst the grasses.
They are of the type of English blossoms, peering out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
shyly from between the green blades, blowing purely
and sweetly in their innocence of the heavy sickliness
of the tropics. It is where the ground is chiefly
dotted with these fresh flowers that the smile of the
Campo is most brilliant.</p>

<p>So much for the immediate surroundings up to
the point where the more intricate markings become
merged in the broader tints of the landscape. Down
in the hollows are bands of dark, close green formed
by the trees that shade the streams. With scarcely
a break in the narrow walls of verdure they run from
valley to valley, accurately defining the banks of
the small rivers whose waters they conceal. Within
these leafy lanes lurk the only spots upon the Campo,
save for the rare woodland, that do not stare frankly
upwards, exposing all their earthly soul to the blue
sky.</p>

<p>Away in the far distance there is a magic glamour.
There the lands are no longer green to the eye. The
soft waves, as they rise and dip in an accumulation of
folds towards the final horizon line, are bathed in
warm purple. The Banda Oriental has been called
"the purple land" by one who knew it well, and
never was a name better applied. Without the foreground&mdash;that
is itself strongly purpled by the banks
of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">flor morula</i>&mdash;all is purple and mystic. The
land has its ordinary mirages as well; but here is
one that at all times confronts the traveller&mdash;that
wonderful land of the horizon that, unattainable, dies
farther away as it is approached.</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding its soft romance, the place
is essentially alive. It is a blowy haunt of clean
fresh airs that sweep the slopes and open valleys to
billow the grass tops and to refresh mankind. It
is amidst such surroundings that the Oriental of the
country dwells. His type is not very numerous, it
is true, and&mdash;although the dearth of houses suits the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
landscape itself most admirably&mdash;the scarcity of habitation
is a little lamentable in so wealthy and
pleasant a land. It is practically certain, as a matter
of fact, that the pastures will bear more roots in
the near future than they have ever known in the
past; but in the meanwhile it is necessary to take
them as they are, and their inhabitants as well.</p>

<p>Of these inhabitants the true <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">paisano</i>, the Gaucho,
decidedly claims the chief share of attention. The
Gaucho of the Banda Oriental is not to be confused
with his brethren of the neighbouring countries. In
appearance he presents perhaps the finest specimen
amongst the various kindred families of his race.
He is taller in stature, and, if possible, even more
athletic in his lithe frame than his neighbour. His
complexion, moreover, though frequently dusky and
invariably tanned, is peculiarly wholesome and fresh.
It was inevitable that the blowy downlands should
have produced a fitting and appropriate breed of
amazingly healthy, hardy, and fearless men to whom
the art of horsemanship has become second nature,
while the occasional enforced spells of pedestrianism
have degenerated into a mere unwelcome accident of
life.</p>

<p>The temperament of the Uruguayan Gaucho shows
corresponding distinction from that of the rest. It
goes without saying that he is strongly imbued with
the grim dignity of the race. Silent austerity here,
however, is modified by lighter traits. In the same
way as the higher social member of his country, he
is more easily moved to laughter than his neighbours,
and indulges from time to time in frank outbursts
of joviality.</p>

<p>For practical purposes it is necessary to regard
this child of the Campo from three standpoints&mdash;from
that of the worker, the player, and the fighter.
It is rare enough that one of them is not called upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
to fill all these three rôles on a good many occasions
during his lifetime. As stock-rider, he has proved
his courage, fidelity, and honesty of purpose to the
full; his moments of recreation are taken up by
equestrian sports, guitar-playing, and chance affairs
of the heart, whilst in warfare he has had only
too many opportunities of displaying his reckless
brilliancy&mdash;frequently, it must be admitted, at the
cost of discipline and order.</p>

<p>In his private quarrels the Argentine Gaucho will
bottle up his wrath until his overflowing passion
culminates without warning in the rapid knife thrust
or revolver shot. The conclusion of a serious dispute
between his Uruguayan brethren will almost
certainly be the same; but the tragic climax will
be approached in quite another fashion. The atmospheric
effervescence of the Banda Oriental will enter
into the case. There will be shouting, vociferation,
and not a little abuse. Not until a fair exchange
of all this has been bandied to and fro will come the
flash of steel or flame&mdash;and the red stain upon the
grasses of the Campo.</p>

<p>That these dwellers upon the downlands should
prove themselves born fighters is no matter for
surprise. For the dusky side of their ancestry they
claim the Charrúa Indians, the fiercest and most
warlike of all the tribes in the neighbouring
provinces. With this strain added to the blood of
the old Spaniards, and the mixture fostered and
nourished by the breezy hills, the result has been a
being whose keen sense of dignity and honour were
ever in the very active custody of knife or lance.</p>

<p>As is perhaps natural enough in a land whose
interests&mdash;as compared with the agricultural development
of the neighbouring countries&mdash;are almost purely
pastoral, the habits and customs of the Oriental have
remained unusually conservative. His poncho is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
veritable poncho, often of a bizarre and daring hue;
his spurs are weapons that glitter in huge circles
at his heels, while his horse furniture is frequently
silvered to the very last degree.</p>

<p>When the Gaucho undertakes a dance&mdash;a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">baile</i>&mdash;moreover,
he enters into the performance with a
zest that puts to shame the human products of a later
civilisation. In order to witness one of the most
homeric of these exhibitions it is necessary to suppose
the revellers in the peculiarly reckless and irresponsible
mood that from time to time falls to their
lot. On such an occasion their wonted strict sobriety
is abruptly melted beneath the flow of the native
spirit, caña, and perhaps that of wine, and of beer.
Then upon the open sward of the Campo they will
dance their <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tangos</i>, stepping it manfully for hour after
hour.</p>

<p>Indeed, strengthened by the intervals of rest,
refreshment, and sleep, it is not unusual for them
to continue these tremendous terpsichorean feats for
two or three days on end. At the conclusion of
which, having danced themselves out and drunk
themselves in, these astonishing mortals are perfectly
ready for their strenuous work in the saddle!</p>

<p>Having concluded with the Gaucho, it soon
becomes evident that the main features of individuality
that distinguish the Uruguayan from his neighbours
are very nearly finished with as well. The
landowner, it is true, still clings in parts to ancient
customs and the remnants of national costume rather
more closely than elsewhere in the Southern republics.
But the distinctions here are less marked, and in the
case of the townsmen have disappeared altogether.
An important factor in the population is now
provided by the large foreign element that has
settled itself permanently in the country. By far
the most numerous communities of these are those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
of the Italians and Spaniards; but in addition there
is scarcely a European country that is not more or
less strongly represented by its emigrants.</p>

<p>The negro race, although its presence is more
marked than in the republics to the West, is quite
insignificant numerically in the South of Uruguay.
Towards the north, however, the numbers of the
Africans are much increased, and as the Brazilian
frontier is closely approached, the black people tend
rather to predominate over the white. It is only
in these remote districts that the possibility of a
racial question could be involved. As a matter of
fact, such an eventuality is quite undreamed of, and
nowhere in the world is it less likely to occur. In
the absence of any drawn distinction the negro
appears to exist in more or less complete peace,
and only meddles with the affairs of the country
during troublous times when instructed by the true
lords of the soil, whose actual superiority would seem
all the greater for the fact of its being unexpressed.</p>

<p>Considering the number of slaves that were
imported directly into Uruguay as well as those that
filtered southwards through Brazil, it is perhaps somewhat
a matter for astonishment that these blacks
are not numerically stronger than is the case. The
explanation lies largely in the numerous wars by
which the country has been harassed in the past, and
in the policy that prevailed under the old Spanish
regime. Black troops were freely employed then,
and it must be admitted that they met with far less
consideration than the rest. If a desperate situation
arose, they were wont to be sent out in search of a
glory that was very remote and of a death that was
very near, not necessarily because the Spaniards
feared for themselves in the attempt, but rather on
account of the science of racial economy, and on the
principle of sacrificing the pawns before the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
aristocratic chessmen. And it is to these wholesale
gaps in the black ranks that the existing scarcity
of the negro population in the South is largely due.</p>

<p>Not that it must be inferred from this that the
general treatment of the African slaves by the
Spaniards was severe. Their fate has always been
entirely distinct from that of the unfortunate native
Indians. The blood of these latter, slain by the
first generation of adventurous <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">conquistadores</i>, flowed
in red rivers almost the length and breadth of South
America, while tens of thousands more sank and
died beneath the superhuman tasks imposed upon
them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless they were not sacrificed from mere
wanton love of slaughter. Held as soulless instruments
from whom the last possible ounce of labour
was to be extracted, these fearful slaughterings were
instigated as acts of discipline that should make more
pliant and serviceable material of the general body,
while the cowed met their slower, toilful death in
order that their masters should obtain wealth ere
the advent from Europe of further competitors who
might desire to share their wealth with them.</p>

<p>After a while the limitations both of the continent
and of the labour capacities of its natives became
evident, and the first spasms of the remorseless and
feverish lust moderated. It was then that the introduction
of the negro occurred. With the maturing
of the continent came a milder and more settled form
of civilisation, of which the dusky imported labourers
obtained the full benefit. That they were well cared
for in times of peace is testified to not only by
the native historians but by perfectly unbiassed
English travellers. One of these, who visited
Uruguay during the last years of the Spanish
dominion, is particularly emphatic on the point.</p>

<p>"There is one trait," he writes, "in the South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
American Spaniards much in their favour. I mean
the mild, humane, and gentle treatment which their
slaves receive. This one would scarcely expect from
the cruelty they manifest to animals. The condition
of the Africans here is without doubt happier than
in any other part of the world where they are held
in slavery, and I will even venture to say, more so
than in their native country. A severe punishment
is seldom inflicted; the tasks imposed on them are
light, and such as they can easily execute. Indeed,
they scarcely seem to be slaves."</p>

<p>If any palliation for enforced human labour were
possible it might be looked for in evidence such
as this. Nevertheless, since nothing of the kind is
admissible, it is well to remember that the slave era
in the River Plate countries is now a matter of comparatively
remote history. Moreover, as though in
compensation for a former servitude, however light,
the lot of the African here is now undoubtedly happier
than almost anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>In addition to the ordinary foreign landowners and
residents in Uruguay are a few of the regular immigrant
colonies the establishment of which has now
become so popular throughout the Southern republics.
Of these the most important is the Swiss Colony in
the neighbourhood of Colonia, to which reference has
already been made.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan estancia life resembles that of
Argentina very closely. And of this latter so much
has been written in recent years that a too lengthy
description of the routine of one of the great cattle
farms would almost inevitably savour of repetition
and superfluity. The duties of both estanciero and
his major-domo are, indeed, almost identical with
those of their brethren upon the other side of the
great river. There are similar rides of inspection
in order to "revise camp," similar great <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">rodeos</i>, or
gatherings of cattle, and a general method of life
that is distinct from the other merely in minor details.</p>

</div>

<p>In the main ethics of the farming itself, it is true,
there are some differences. Seeing that Uruguay is
a pastoral rather than an agricultural land, the system
of setting apart a certain proportion of a private
estancia for the purpose of colonisation by crop-raising
tenants is almost unknown. On the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
hand, as it happens that the soil of a portion of almost
every province is suitable for viticulture, a great
number of the Uruguayan landowners throughout the
republic cultivate vineyards&mdash;an industry that in
Argentina is confined almost entirely to the two great
grape-growing centres of Mendoza and San Juan.
In many districts of the Banda Oriental, moreover,
fruit-growing forms part and parcel of the industrial
programme of an estancia, instead of necessarily
forming an entirely separate branch of commerce,
as is the case in Argentina.</p>

<p>Although I have referred to Uruguay as an essentially
pastoral country, it must not be inferred from
this that the cultivation of cereals and the like has
no existence in the land. On the contrary, many
districts&mdash;notably that of Colonia, the most fertile
in the Republic&mdash;produce really important quantities
of wheat and maize, and a certain amount of linseed
beyond, although this latter is grown in a minor
degree. Very few districts in the country are
adapted for the favourable cultivation of alfalfa, a
fact that is undoubtedly to be regretted, since the
merits of this lucerne for the purposes of fattening
cattle are supreme. Yet this disadvantage is to a
great extent counterbalanced by the excellent pastures
of natural grass with which Uruguay is so plentifully
endowed.</p>

<p>It is likely enough, too, that the system of private
agricultural colonisation referred to above will in
the future be seriously undertaken. At the present
moment experiments in this direction are being
undertaken, and, should the landowners become impressed
with the success of the departure, it is quite
possible that the system will spread with the same
rapidity as was the case in Argentina.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the supreme interest of Uruguay
remains pastoral; and the bulls and the rams continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
to be lords in the land. In a sense this is
undoubtedly just as well, for in all probability never
was the outlook for grazing countries more favourable
than it is at the present moment, when the exports
of North America are rapidly dying away, and the
markets of Europe are opening their metaphorical
mouths in a clamorous demand for further supplies.</p>

<p>Some of the largest and most imposing of the
Uruguayan estancias are situated in the western districts
of the Republic. Many of these, such as the
Bichadero, Ombú, and others, are owned by the
Lemco Company, and constitute most imposing
estates, stocked by pedigree cattle.</p>

<p>The San Juan estancia is situated in the neighbourhood
of Colonia, and, under the able management
of Mr. J. Booth, affords one of the best possible
examples of an estate whose lands have been aptly
utilised to serve various purposes. The estancia is
noted in the first place for the quality of its live
stock&mdash;and with no little reason, since it harbours
over a thousand head of pedigree shorthorn and
Hereford cattle.</p>

<p>But the energies of the San Juan estancia are not
confined to the raising of cattle and the production
of maize. Viticulture is a matter of great importance
here, for the place enjoys a great repute for
the quality of its wine. Its vineyards, as a matter
of fact, repose on a subsoil of iron-stone rocks, which
lends a particularly pleasant flavour to the vintages.
In addition to the great vineyards that spread themselves
over portions of the estate, the cellars of its
bodega are well worth a visit. The building is
specially constructed for the purpose, and contains
air-spaces between the inner and outer walls, thus
rendering the interior to all intents and purposes
damp-proof.</p>

<p>The cellars contain forty-two large casks, each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
with a capacity for holding 3,600 litres, and, beyond
these, twelve giant specimens, in each of which eight
thousand litres of wine may be stored. The extent
of the vineyards on the place is thirty hectares, and
from this area an average 250,000 litres of wine are
produced annually. Thus it will be seen that the
vineyard industry of San Juan is of no mean
importance.</p>

<p>Among the other branches of general industry in
which San Juan is interested is that of stone-quarries,
the quality and extent of the deposits here being
considerable. A large bee-farm is also attached to
the place. In addition to this comprehensive programme
there are, of course, the ordinary side-issues
of estancia production in the way of both live stock
and agriculture. Among the horses bred are not a
few racers of pedigree stock that have given a good
account of themselves in the neighbourhood and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The estancia-house of San Juan is delightfully
situated amidst orange, wattle, and paraiso trees, from
whose trunks and branches hang festoons of air-plants
and masses of yellow orchids. From the
picturesque, shaded building itself the view embraces
miles of undulating country on all sides, with a few
distant peeps of the waters of the River Plate to
the south-west. It would be difficult to conceive a
pleasanter or a better managed spot.</p>

<p>Such estancias as these, of course, represent the
cream of the land, and Uruguayan "camp" life
must not be judged as a whole by such particularly
favourable examples. Even the foreigner in the
Republic, whose life is wont to be rather more fully
surrounded with comfort than that of his native-born
brother, must perforce make a beginning, and,
as in all else, it is always the first steps that are the
roughest. It is said that one of the first requisites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of a gardener is a cast-iron back. In the same way
the primary needs of the budding estanciero are
undoubtedly health and a good horse. In these
respects he is likely to be well suited, for the climate
will attend to the former and his <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">patron</i> to the
latter.</p>

<p>I have already said that the scenes upon the
Uruguayan estancias are much the same as elsewhere,
but the following sketch may serve to show a little
of the local colour with which the rural Oriental
landscape and life are imbued:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="etc">
To face p. 250.
</p>

</div>

<p>The bullock is grazing in the midst of his fellows,
plucking stolidly at the spring grass, whose close
blades paint the undulations of the Uruguayan Campo
in soft green. No pedigree animal this, his lengthy
horns, rather pointed nose, and shaggy mottled coat
being redeemed by various features that tend to raise
him from the mere ruck of the disappearing country-bred.
There is a trace of Hereford in the compact
form, straight back, and in the symptoms of red-brown
and white that endeavour to assert themselves
from out of the confusion of his other markings.
Representing one of the earlier stages in the forward
march of the local breeds, he is of the type known
to experts by the cryptic word "useful"&mdash;a
meritorious physical condition whose reward is wont
to fructify in an earlier death than that accorded
to those of his brethren who are less liberal in meat.
At the present moment the bullock is supremely content,
although profoundly unconscious of the charm
of his surroundings. This is perhaps just as well,
since his ribs would undoubtedly emerge from their
plump covering were he to waste the precious
moments of mastication in favour of less material
delights. As it is, he tramples carelessly on the
patches of scarlet verbena, and crushes the life from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
the white tobacco blossom and the blue lupin flower
with a ponderous impartiality. It is enough for him
that the warm sunlight beats down upon his back,
and that the plentiful grass rises to his cud in a
ceaseless green stream. Moreover, the few score of
companions that surround him lend a dimly-felt but
comforting sense of comradeship.</p>

<p>From the green of the foreground to the blue and
mysterious distant swellings of the horizon the face
of the Campo has been devoid of humanity. Near
by a humble rancho, it is true, raises its diffident
walls from the earth, a lowly erection of turf and
reeds, enlivened here and there by a small auxiliary
patch of corrugated iron, that catches up the sun-rays
to flash them back in brilliant defiance. But there
are no signs of life about the place beyond that
afforded by a couple of hens of worn and frayed
appearance that make rapid and spiteful passes at
the dust with their beaks. Only when the sun is
falling near to the horizon does the first sign manifest
itself of more active stirrings. The figures of
two horsemen have emerged from behind a distant
clump of eucalyptus that stands out like a green
island from the midst of a rolling sea.</p>

<p>As the riders draw nearer it is plain that they are
Gauchos&mdash;Gauchos in a workaday mood, and consequently
in attire far less picturesque than that which
lends colour to their feast days. Yet they afford
striking enough figures of men in their sombreros,
kerchiefs, white shirts, broad trousers, horse-hide
boots, and giant spurs. Each part and parcel of
his horse, they come loping easily along with that
curious air of careless alertness that is characteristic
of the Gaucho. With the first warning of human
approach the cattle have raised their heads in the
wary and rather resentful stare that the presence
of such visitors demands. When no doubt longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
remains that the grim-faced riders are heading
directly for their own company, doubt turns to active
alarm. There is a flinging up of heels and tails,
a bunching together of scattered units, and a surging
to and fro, while the horns wave in a panic of indecision.
The bullock with the traces of Hereford
markings has run to a common centre with the rest.</p>

<p>A moment later the horses are cleaving the ranks
of the cattle, and the cumbrous bodies of the horned
creatures go floundering to right and left just as
they have floundered a dozen times before, with precisely
the same degree, moreover, of dread and confusion.
Dodging and twisting ponderously, they rush
to and fro for a while, then flee with a thunder of
hoofs from the impact, ending up in a breathless
halt at length to turn their horns upon one another
in a fury of terror. All but the bullock with the
scanty Hereford markings. He has raced and
charged with the rest, only to find on each occasion
a horse's flank or chest barring the way to safety,
and a threatening human arm raised on high that
sent him without further ado to the right-about.
And now the situation is doubtless quite inexplicable,
since the rumbling of his companions' hoofs has died
away, and he is racing across the Campo quite alone
save for the horseman who gallops remorselessly on
either flank&mdash;fatal attendants who are no more to
be shaken off than the hairs of his hide. A lasso
circles lightly in the air, uncoiling as it goes like
an aerial snake: the noose falls with a gentle rattle
on the hurrying animal's horns. A terrific jerk shakes
him from tail to nostril. But the bullock has kept
his legs, and stands firm now, pulling with all his
might against the strain that follows, heaving from
side to side in his fight with the rope that never
slackens. There is a thudding of horses' hoofs at
his quarters now. Enraged at the presence of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
second foe, the bullock kicks wildly, and the action
is the signal for his doom. Another rope has whistled
through the air, and has encircled his fetlock in
some demoniacal fashion. In consequence, he gives
a strenuous jump into the air&mdash;his last, for ere his
feet have touched the ground his legs are wrenched
away from under him, and the heavy body of the
creature, flung full upon its side, strikes the earth
with a crash. Ere he can move the beat of galloping
horses' hoofs has drawn near, and ceased. Two
men have sprung to the ground, and are securing
his legs with ropes; then one rises to draw the
blade of a huge knife from its sheath at his belt.
A minute later there is a pool of darker crimson by
the side of the verbena patches. A couple of hours
later there is a log fire upon the Campo, and the
beef is being cut into long strips from where it is
spitted above the blaze, and eaten wholesale as
Gaucho appetite demands. In the meanwhile the
carancho birds are gathering thickly above, for meat
is cheap upon the open pastures, and they will be
economically-minded Gauchos indeed who do not
leave them the greater share of the carcass.</p>

<p>The great numbers of the live stock which to-day
constitute the chief wealth of Uruguay owe their
origin to the animals introduced by the Spanish
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">conquistadores</i> at the beginning of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>These animals, which, of course, were drawn from
the breeds that existed in Spain at that period, found
themselves surrounded by conditions that were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
eminently favourable. Thus, beneath the influence
of a temperate climate and of the rich and nourishing
pastures that cover almost the entire surface
of the Republic their numbers rapidly multiplied. It
is for these reasons, moreover, that the breeding
and traffic in these animals constitutes at the present
day the principal industry of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The live stock census organised by the Government
in the year 1909 gave the following results
concerning the numbers of the live stock that are
now in existence in the Republic:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="stock">
<tr><td align="left">Sheep</td><td align="right">16,608,717</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Cattle</td><td align="right">6,827,428</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Horses</td><td align="right">561,408</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Pigs</td><td align="right">93,923</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Mules</td><td align="right">22,992</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Goats</td><td align="right">20,428</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">&nbsp;</td><td align="right">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">Total</td><td align="right">24,134,896</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>These figures might reasonably be increased, since
it was necessarily impossible for the census to deal
with the complete numbers of the animals that exist
throughout the country. Thus, without danger of
exaggeration, it may be supposed that some thirty
million head of live stock actually graze upon the
pastures of the land. These figures suffice to show
the enormous importance to which live stock breeding
has attained in Uruguay.</p>

<p>The ramifications of this industry are naturally
numerous. For home consumption and internal commerce
meat, milk, and tallow form the principal
items. For the export trade the list is considerably
more comprehensive. Live cattle, frozen, chilled,
tinned, and dried meat, beef extracts, wool, horns,
hides, tallow, fat, guano, and the various other
products now make up a commerce of an annual
value of thirty millions of gold dollars, or of rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
more than six million pounds sterling. Chilled or
frozen beef and mutton form the principal items
of this export trade, after which hides and extract
of meat rank next in importance.</p>

<p>The main breeds of animals introduced by the
Spaniards at the time of the conquest, although they
served their purpose well enough at the time, were
by no means of the type which the exigencies of
modern times require. The cattle of former years
were wanting in many respects. They were wont
to possess, for example, a superabundance of bone,
were badly built, and were notably backward in development.
The sheep were possessed of the same
faults, and, in addition, were wont to yield inferior
wool.</p>

<p>The horses, on the other hand, although of light
build and lacking somewhat in shape, have proved
themselves particularly well suited to the country.
Hardy and of great power of endurance, they have
adapted themselves completely to the natural conditions
of the land. From this stock a breed has
sprung that fulfils admirably the equine duties of
the Campo. The tendency of these horses has been
to improve and to increase in size. Both the pigs
and goats that were imported from Spain were of
an inferior order, although the latter showed favourable
results in the yielding of milk.</p>

<p>By the aid of these breeds alone it is certain
that the live stock of Uruguay could never have
attained to that degree of excellence in quality such
as it can legitimately boast to-day. From these,
for example, cattle could never have been produced
of the class that the freezing works now demand,
nor the valuable wool that is characteristic of the
day. The beginning of this later progress dates
from the middle of the last century. It was then
that the more progressive breeders became aware<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of the limitations of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">criollo</i> races, as are termed
the breeds imported from Spain that have flourished
and taken root in the land. To this end these were
crossed with others of a superior type, and thus
the much-improved <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mestizos</i>, or cross-breds, were
obtained. These now preponderate in many regions
of the Republic, in which, by the way, no true criollo
animals now remain.</p>

<p>In order to effect this improvement in the cattle
various English breeds have been introduced. Of
these the two most important are the Durham and
the Hereford, both of which are excellently adapted
for the production of meat. By the crossing of these
with the criollo a mestizo steer is obtained, capable
of turning the scale at six hundred kilos and more,
that provides excellent meat whether for the purposes
of live shipment, freezing, salting, or extract. In
addition to these more important breeds others have
been introduced, such as the Devon, Polled Angus,
and a few further varieties&mdash;all these, however, in
a lesser degree.</p>

<p>It will be evident from this that the improvements
in stock have been effected chiefly with the
view of increasing the quantity of meat produced.
Nevertheless, there are others that have been imported
for dairy purposes alone. The chief of these
are the Dutch, Norman, Flemish, and Swiss. It
must be remarked that the popularity of these is
rapidly growing, on account of the progress and
extension of the dairy industry.</p>

<p>So far as sheep are concerned, the breeds that
have been found most suitable for the country are
the Merino, Lincoln, Shropshire, Hampshire, Romney
Marsh, and Southdown. The Merino race amidst
its new surroundings provides an especially fine class
of wool that is appreciated throughout the world;
from the crossing of the Merino with the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
breeds animals are obtained that provide the best
meat for the purposes of export, and those types of
wool that are most in demand for general commercial
purposes.</p>

<p>The horses principally employed for saddle
purposes and for light draught are the thorough-bred,
Yorkshire, Anglo-Norman, Irish, and Russian,
while for heavy draught the Percheron, Clydesdale,
and Shire strains are the most popular.</p>

<p>The improvement in pig-breeding has been effected
by the introduction of several English species, such
as the Yorkshire and Berkshire, the French animals
of the kind being rarely employed.</p>

<p>It is by means of the crossing with all these
above-mentioned breeds that the general live stock
of the country has been raised in degree. The
result has been distinctly favourable, since the
healthy climate and the pastures are eminently
suitable for the finest strains as well as for the
cross-breds.</p>

<p>The annual importation into Uruguay of sires,
bulls, and of the remaining stock is now large. The
countries whence they are derived are England and
other European lands, Australia, Argentina, and
North America. Amongst these many valuable
animals are to be met with. Thus recently two
champion rams have been imported from Australia,
various champion bulls and rams from England,
while from France came the noted Durham bull
"Tamarin."</p>

<p>Uruguay, however, does not now depend entirely
upon importations from abroad for its pedigree stock.
It already possesses a number of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">cabañas</i>, or breeding
establishments, from which emerge cattle and
sheep of a grade sufficiently high to meet with success
in the agricultural shows of other countries. These
are to be distinguished from the estancias, the farms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of larger area upon which the general live stock of
commerce thrives.</p>

<p>The ordinary estancia consists of a number of
paddocks, separated the one from the other by wire
fences, of the natural pastures that abound in
Uruguay. The advance that has been effected in
these great enterprises is on a par with that of the
rest. They are as a rule well provided with sheds
for the housing of the pedigree stock and with plantations
of trees for the shelter of the less valuable
type of animal, as well as with cattle-dips, water
deposits, and stockyards, and, in fact, with every
installation that is requisite for the purpose of the
industry.</p>

<p>In every department of the Republic societies have
been founded in order to encourage scientific breeding,
and to organise the agricultural shows that are
now held throughout the country. These agricultural
meetings have served a most useful purpose
in fostering an interest in breeding and in the various
other branches of the general national industries.
This fact has been recognised by the Government,
which, in consequence, has done its utmost to stimulate
the holding of such functions. It has thus
during the past few years spent an annual sum of
fifty thousand dollars in the subsidising of these
events, an outlay that has undoubtedly borne good
fruit. In providing these subsidies it is stipulated
that at least a third part of the sum provided shall
be expended in cash prizes, and that the chief attention
in this respect shall be devoted to those particular
branches of industry that appear in a less advanced
condition than the rest, and that, therefore, are the
most in need of encouragement.</p>

<p>Many of these agricultural societies possess extensive
grounds of their own in the near neighbourhood
of the provincial capital. In these places permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
buildings are frequently to be met with that are
employed for the annual shows. These usually owe
their construction to private enterprise, assisted by
the Government. In Montevideo, too, there is a
ground specially set apart for this purpose. Here
the Rural Association of Uruguay holds the great
annual championship meeting, and the Government
has just allotted the sum of a hundred thousand
dollars for the purpose of improving the spot, and
for the introduction of the very latest innovations.
These agricultural shows have proved highly successful
in facilitating the actual commercial transactions
having reference to live stock of all descriptions.
Thus during the past few years the principal meetings
alone have been responsible for an annual
sale of over half a million dollars' worth of
animals.</p>

<p>Although, as has been explained, numerous
products of the pastoral industry are exported in
their natural state, there are others which require
special treatment and preparation in their country
of origin ere shipment, and which are daily gaining
in importance. The most important institutions
that deal with these are the meat-curing factories,
the freezing works, and the establishments for preserving
meat and for extracting its essence. These
chief industries we will deal with at some length
later, enumerating first of all some of the side products
of lesser importance, such as the manufacture
of tallow and of hams, and that of tanning.</p>

<p>Another industry that bids fair to be of supreme
importance in the future is that of dairy-farming.
At the present time this is worked on a comparatively
modest scale, since the great majority of farms are
content with the breeding and selling of the cattle.
Nevertheless, there are several important establishments
that produce milk, butter, and cheese for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the purposes of both home consumption and of
export.</p>

<p>The chief amongst these establishments is that of
La Carolina, belonging to Don Francisco Fontana,
which occupies an area of eight thousand hectares
in the department of Rocha. No less than five
thousand milch cows graze on this property, which
is provided with steam-driven machinery of the most
modern type. In the department of Colonia, too,
exists the colony of Swiss, who devote themselves
especially to this particular branch of industry. The
principal factory here is that of Breuss and Frey,
which deals with thirty thousand litres of milk daily,
and can turn out twenty-four thousand kilos of butter
in a month. This factory likewise contains the most
up-to-date machinery, and is provided with freezing
and sterilising apparatus. This concern exports
cheese as well as butter.</p>

<p>These few facts will give an idea of the point to
which the dairy-farming industry in Uruguay may
develop in the near future, since there exist several
millions of cows of a type eminently suitable for the
purpose.</p>

<p>In the Republic there are actually twenty saladeros
in existence, of which thirteen are situated in
Montevideo, seven on the banks of the River
Uruguay, and one at Paso de los Toros, in the
interior of the country.</p>

<p>The number of the animals slaughtered at these
saladeros will give an idea of the importance of the
industry. During the years 1904 and 1908 the total
amounted to no less than 2,763,855 head of cattle,
thus making the average for the year over half a
million head. During these five years 223,872,000
kilos of <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">tasajo</i>, or dried meat, were prepared, which
represent a yearly average of forty-five million kilos.
The average yield of the steers was ninety kilos
of tasajo, that of the cows sixty kilos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>The manner in which this dried meat is prepared
in the saladeros is fairly simple. After the cattle
have been slaughtered and the veterinary examination
has proved the absence of any taint or disease
the bones are separated from the meat, which is
then shaped into various portions known respectively
as <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">mantas</i> and <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">postas</i>. Once dried, these are placed
in brine-pans, and piled up, well covered with salt.
According to the state of the weather and the condition
to which the meat is required to attain, it
is placed in special vessels in the sun for a period
varying between four and six days, until it is perfectly
dry and ready to be baled.</p>

<p>As will be seen from this, salt and sun heat are
the two principal agents that enter into the manufacture
of tasajo, two powerful agents that, it is
claimed, perform their task in the simplest and most
hygienic fashion possible. The slaughtering season
in the saladeros generally begins in the month of
November, and is continued until January of the
following year.</p>

<p>Tasajo, when its manufacture is completed, is
classified into four grades, in accordance with the
fatter or leaner propensities of the meat. The
former kinds are exported principally to the markets
of Brazil, while the latter are for the most part
destined for consumption in Cuba. Beyond these,
however, there are various other fields in which tasajo
plays a popular part. It is, for instance, sent in
fairly large quantities to the Portuguese colonies,
to Puerto Rico, and to Spain and Portugal themselves,
as well as to numerous less important places
whose inhabitants have learned to appreciate this
particular form of dried meat. The product contains
certain advantages in that its treatment is
simple throughout. Thus, when once in the hands
of its actual consumers, the salt has merely to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
dissolved from the meat in order to render it in
a condition prepared for the oven.</p>

<p>It is several years now since Uruguay has commenced
to export frozen meat. Six years ago an
important freezing establishment, La Frigorifica
Uruguaya, was founded in the department of Montevideo
on the bank of the River Plate. The place
occupies a large extent of ground, and is
capable of slaughtering daily two hundred head of
cattle and two thousand sheep. This establishment
is fitted up with the most recent inventions that have
been brought to bear on the freezing process. The
frozen beef is classified into three qualities, according
to type and weight, and is packed in quarters
in a double covering that completely preserves it
from the danger of contact with other substances.
The carcasses of the sheep, following the usual
custom, are shipped entire, and covered in the
same way.</p>

<p>The Frigorifica Uruguaya began operations in
1905. The rapid increase in the extent of its shipments
may be judged from the following figures.
Thus, in 1905, the year of its inception, the establishment
exported two thousand tons of frozen meat;
in 1906 the shipments had increased to four thousand
tons, whereas in 1907 the total amounted to seven
thousand and in 1908 to nine thousand tons. This
increase has continued unchecked during the past
couple of years, and the shipments for 1910 are
estimated to have amounted to no less than twelve
thousand tons. The machinery has now been
added to, and the result will certainly go to swell
these figures considerably more in the near
future.</p>

<p>The benefit that this concern confers on the
pastoral industry is of course very great. Not only
does it increase the facilities for sale of the cattle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
but its existence tends in addition towards the improvement
of breed in general, since only the animals
of a superior class are suitable for the purpose it
serves.</p>

<p>A list of the nineteen departments of Uruguay with
their more salient features will go far towards
explaining in detail the various areas, populations,
and resources of the Republic.</p>

<p>Canelones, situated in the midst of the departments
of Montevideo, San José, Florida, Minas, and
Maldonado, with a coast-line upon the River Plate,
possesses an area of 4,751 square kilometres. It
is one of the most populous departments, containing
over ninety thousand inhabitants. Three railway-lines
connect the district with Montevideo. Its chief
towns are Guadeloupe, Santa Lucia, Pando, and Las
Piedras, each of which contains some eight thousand
inhabitants. Canelones is mainly devoted to pasture,
agriculture, viticulture, and general fruit-growing.</p>

<p>Florida is situated directly to the north of Canelones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
Its area is 12,107 square kilometres and its
population fifty thousand. Two lines of railway
connect it with Montevideo. The chief town is
Florida, the capital of the department, a city of
ten thousand inhabitants. Until recent years Florida
has been almost altogether given up to the pastoral
industry; but of late agriculture has made great
strides.</p>

<p>San José is situated to the west of Canelones, and
likewise possesses a coast-line on the River Plate.
Its area is 6,932 square kilometres; population about
fifty thousand. The department is connected with
Montevideo by two railway lines. The principal town
is San José de Mayo, with a population of just
over twelve thousand inhabitants. Rather more than
half the department is made up of rich pasture-lands,
although the agricultural districts are increasing.
In addition to fruit-growing and viticulture, the
timber industry of San José is important, consisting
of wood both for building purposes and for fuel.</p>

<p>Durazno, to the north of Florida, is the most
central department in the Republic, and contains
a population of fifty thousand inhabitants. It is
connected by a railway line with Montevideo, and
its chief city is San Pedro del Durazno, whose
inhabitants number eleven thousand. The department
is essentially a pastoral one, and is especially
well watered, being served by the Rivers Negro
and Yi, and by countless tributaries and smaller
streams.</p>

<p>Flores, situated to the west of Durazno, contains
twenty thousand inhabitants. Almost half this
number are residents of the capital, Trinidad. Flores
is not yet served by a railway, and it is probably
for this reason that so many of its districts, admirably
adapted for agriculture, still remain essentially
pastoral. In Flores is a very curious grotto,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
sustained by natural arches and columns, that has
been the source of much geological controversy.</p>

<p>Colonia is the richest and most important department
of all in the Republic. Lying to the west of
San José, it has the advantage not only of railways
but of a lengthy coast-line on the River Plate. Agriculture
here has attained to a high pitch of development,
and dairy-farming constitutes one of the most
important industries of the department. Fruit culture
and viticulture are in an equally advanced condition,
while the quarrying of building stone is now being
energetically carried on. In Colonia is situated the
Swiss Colony, the inhabitants of which apply themselves
to agriculture and dairy-farming.</p>

<p>Soriano lies to the north of Colonia, and its western
boundary is likewise washed by the waters of the
river&mdash;no longer the River Plate, but the Uruguay.
The area of the department is 9,223 kilometres, and
its population rather exceeds forty thousand. Soriano
is connected by railway with Montevideo. Its chief
town is Mercedes, the population of which amounts
to ten thousand inhabitants. The principal industry
is pasture, although agriculture and general fruit-growing
is carried on to a certain extent. Timber,
charcoal-burning, and stone-quarrying are responsible
for a certain amount of labour. A fair quantity of
minerals such as iron, silver, copper, and lead is
met with here.</p>

<p>Rio Negro is situated on the Uruguay River to the
north of Colonia. Its area is 8,470 kilometres and
its population twenty thousand. The department is
now in the act of being linked up with the main
centres by railway. Its capital is Fray Bentos,
a town celebrated as one of the chief centres
of the manufacture of meat extract, with a population
of seven thousand inhabitants. Rio Negro is
essentially a pastoral province, and is the chief centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
in the Republic for the breeding of live stock, which
attains here to an exceptionally high grade of
quality. Rio Negro is one of the most favourably
situated departments as regards water communication.
In addition to its 120 kilometres of coast-line
on the Uruguay it possesses 200 kilometres of river
frontage on the River Negro.</p>

<p>Paysandú bounds Rio Negro to the north, with
a lengthy frontage on the Uruguay River. Its
population is forty thousand, of which twenty-one
thousand inhabit the capital, Paysandú, the second
town of importance in Uruguay. The area of the
department is about 14,000 square kilometres.
Paysandú is connected by railway both with the
capital and the northern centres. Its industries are
chiefly pastoral and agricultural, and a number of
meat-curing establishments exist.</p>

<p>Salto is the neighbouring province to the north
upon the River Uruguay. It contains an area of
12,500 square kilometres and a population of rather
over fifty thousand. Its chief town is Salto, that in
actual size is said to exceed that of Paysandú,
numbering as it does rather over twenty-two thousand
inhabitants. The department is served by railway.
The principal industry is that of pasture. The department,
moreover, is one of the chief wine-producing
centres of the Republic. Salto is rich in minerals,
and quartz and precious stones are met with in fair
quantities here.</p>

<p>Artigas is the northernmost province on the
Uruguay as well as in the Republic. Its area is
11,300 square kilometres, its population thirty thousand.
Its capital is San Eugenio, situated on the
Brazilian frontier, a town of nine thousand inhabitants.
The railway runs as far as this point, and
thus serves the length of the province. Artigas contains
many districts notable for minerals, and is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
endowed with precious stones such as the amethyst
and topaz. Owing to the northern situation of the
department grazing and agriculture are carried on
to a lesser extent than in the majority of others.
The variety of timber is important here, hard woods
being found as well as the softer varieties.</p>

<p>Tacuarembó is situated in the northern centre
of the Republic. That is to say, its frontiers extend
from the centre to within a comparatively short
distance of the Brazilian frontier. The department is
the largest in Uruguay, its territories extending over
more than twenty-one thousand square kilometres. Its
population, however, does not exceed fifty thousand,
and it is thus the most sparsely inhabited department
of the country. It is served by a railway. The
principal town is San Fructuoso, which possesses
eight thousand inhabitants. Tacuarembó is for the
most part devoted to agriculture. Tobacco flourishes
in the province, and recent experimental rice plantations
have met with a fair amount of success. Gold
and manganese are met with in various districts.</p>

<p>Rivera is bounded on the south by Tacuarembó
and on the north by Brazil. It is a fairly extensive
department containing comparatively few inhabitants,
but the precise figures of neither the one nor the other
seem available. The chief town of the department
is Rivera, a city situated on the Brazilian frontier
that has a population of ten thousand. The industries
of Rivera are similar to those of Tacuarembó.
The gold mines here are of considerable importance,
and are in active working. The department is served
by railway, Rivera being the northernmost Uruguayan
point of the line from Montevideo.</p>

<p>Cerro Largo is situated on the south-east of
Rivera, and is bounded on the north-east by Brazil.
The area of the department is nearly fifteen thousand
square kilometres; population about forty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
thousand. Its capital is Melo, a town of fourteen
thousand inhabitants. It is the terminus of a recently
constructed railway-line, the entry of which into the
country has had the effect of benefiting local commerce
to a considerable extent. The principal
industry is pastoral, but, in addition, a certain
amount of agriculture is carried on.</p>

<p>Treinta y Tres, which lies to the south of Cerro
Largo, possesses an area of 9,550 square kilometres
and a population of thirty thousand. It has not the
advantage of being served by any railway, although
this will shortly occur. The principal town is Treinta
y Tres, whose inhabitants are about eight thousand
in number. Up to the present time the pastoral
industry predominates here, that of agriculture being
scarcely known. It is anticipated, however, that the
coming development of the province will alter
this condition of affairs. The department is well
wooded, and the timber industry here is an important
one. Treinta y Tres is bounded on the east wholly
by the great Lake of Merin, upon the further shore
of which lies Brazil.</p>

<p>Rocha, to the south of Treinta y Tres, is also
bounded for the great part of its eastern frontier
by Lake Merin, although a small portion of Brazil
and a long stretch of Atlantic Ocean complete its
boundaries in this direction. The department contains
an area of eleven thousand kilometres and a
population of forty thousand. It is not traversed
by a railroad. Its chief industry is grazing; but
in some districts viticulture is in an advanced state.
The seal fishery affords an important revenue, and
the mineral products of the country are considerable.
Copper, gypsum, alabaster, marble, and jasper
obtain in considerable quantities. The chief town
is Rocha, a centre of unimportant size.</p>

<p>Maldonado is situated on the Atlantic Ocean, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
west of Rocha. Its extent and population are not
officially given. In a short while the department will
be adequately served by the railway, which has
already entered its frontiers. Like the great
majority of the departments it is principally devoted
to pasture. A certain amount of agriculture and
wine-growing obtains, and in the southern districts
much timber has been planted. The seal fishery
in the neighbourhood of Lobos Island, off its coast,
is important. The capital of the department is
Maldonado, a small coastal town.</p>

<p>Minas, to the north of Maldonado, has a population
of about sixty thousand. In addition to its pasture
and agriculture, the department is exceptionally well
endowed with minerals. The capital is Minas, a
city of fourteen thousand inhabitants, that forms the
terminus of the railway-line from Montevideo.</p>

<p>The department of Montevideo constitutes the
small extent of territory in the neighbourhood of
the capital itself, a considerable portion of which is
taken up by the outer suburbs of the main town. The
country in the neighbourhood here is very fertile and
highly cultivated.</p>

<p>There is probably no climate in South America
that offers greater attractions than that of
Uruguay. Throughout the Republic the conditions
are favourable; but it stands to reason that
those which obtain upon the coast-line facing the
Atlantic are the most ideal of all. The climate in
these neighbourhoods is essentially temperate, and
may be likened to that of the Riviera of France,
without, however, suffering from the occasional winter
frosts and intense summer heat that characterise this
latter seaboard. Nevertheless the winter temperature
of the Uruguayan littoral when a southern wind
is blowing can be quite as keen as is compatible
with comfort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>As is the case in the majority of temperate
countries, there is no accurately defined rainy or
dry reason, although the rains are wont to be far
more abundant in the winter months. The heat of
summer in the south-eastern provinces is very
seldom oppressive; indeed, one of the most striking
characteristics of the warm season is the continuance
of the refreshing and bracing airs that temper the
heat, and that render midsummer itself as enjoyable
as the delightful spring months. The climate of
Buenos Aires is distinctly pleasant, but, so far as
the summer season is concerned, the difference
between that of the capitals of Argentina and
Uruguay is curiously marked, when it is taken into
consideration that not more than 120 miles of water
separate the two. The exceptionally pleasant conditions
that prevail on this portion of the Oriental
coast are acknowledged by none more readily than
by the Argentines, who flock there in great numbers
for the purposes of bathing and general climatic
refreshment in January and February.</p>

<p>The wind-swept uplands of the interior are
favoured in a similar degree when compared with
the districts of the other countries in corresponding
latitudes. In the northern provinces upon the
Brazilian frontier the increase in the normal temperature
is, of course, very distinctly perceptible, and
for the first time the vegetation gives undoubted
evidence of an approach to the tropics.</p>

</p>

</div>

<p>In consequence of this temperate climate that it
enjoys the natural plagues of the Banda Oriental are
few. Drought, although it occurs from time to time,
cannot be looked upon as a genuinely characteristic
chastening influence of the land. The visitations of
locusts constitute a more serious matter. These, as
in the case of the neighbouring countries, occur in
cycles, and the periods marked by the presence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
the small winged creatures with the insatiable
appetites are unpleasant enough for the agriculturalist.
Owing to the great pastoral predominance
in Uruguay, however, the country in general suffers
far less than one more devoted to the production of
cereals. With the spread of agriculture that is now
in progress the question is likely to become more
serious. But by the time that a reasonable proportion
of the Republic has been brought under cultivation
it is possible that one of the many plans that are
continually being brought forward for the extermination
of the locust curse may have taken effect.
Nevertheless, too much reliance is not to be placed
upon this very desirable consummation.</p>

<p>The great majority of Uruguayan fauna are
identical with those of the River Plate countries in
general. The animals most commonly to be met with
in a journey through the Campo are the carpincho,
a large, tailless water-hog; the nutria, a creature
that closely resembles a gigantic rat, although its
hind feet are webbed; the skunk, the opossum, the
iguana, and the armadillo.</p>

<p>In the region of bird life the larger varieties most
in evidence are the carancho, a cross between a
vulture and a hawk; the chimangu, a smaller
carrion-hawk, and a kestrel-hawk with brown body
and bright grey wings. Far rarer are the large
grey eagle, and the cuerbo, or black vulture. Heron
of various species are very plentiful.</p>

<p>Of the smaller birds the teru-tero, a variety of
crested plover, is by far the most numerous, although
certain districts exist in which the duck and teal
run them a close second in point of numbers, while
partridge and martineta are to be met with in
abundance in others.</p>

<p>Amongst the more gorgeous winged specimens of
the country are the flamingo, parrot, woodpecker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
humming-bird, and the little black pecho colorado
with its brilliant scarlet breast. Both the scissor bird
and the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">viuda</i> (window) bird are aptly named. The
former rejoices in a very long, divided tail; the
latter is of a pure white colour with a well-defined
black border to its wings. The "bien te veo, bicho
feo" is a mocking-bird whose call closely resembles
the phrase by which it is known, and the ornero, or
oven bird, is so called from the curious structure
of its mud nest. The small owl, too, is a notable
inhabitant of the Campo, as are the dainty miniature
doves. But to enter fully into the animal life of the
Banda Oriental would require a book in itself; therefore
it is necessary to be content with a list of the
varieties most commonly to be met with.</p>

<p>In dealing with the category of birds I have purposely
left the ostrich to the last, as that particular
biped stands, as it were, in a class of its own. The
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Rhea Americana</i> represents a commercial asset of
no little importance, and the grey companies of these
rather awkward-looking creatures are carefully
watched now as they strut solemnly to and fro over
the pastures. The feathers, it is true, cannot as a
rule rival in quality those of the African bird,
although occasionally some very fine specimens are to
be met with. Indeed, it is said that the large,
specially selected feathers are sold at prices that
range from fifteen dollars to twenty-five dollars the
kilo. The great majority of the coarser feathers are
of little value, and are employed for dusting brushes
and such similar purposes.</p>

<p>That the commerce in these ostrich feathers is of
no little importance becomes evident when the shipments
of the article are considered. In 1908 the
exports of these to France, the United States, Spain,
and Germany amounted to fifteen thousand kilos,
while in 1909 they had increased to twenty-five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
thousand kilos. The numbers of the ostriches themselves,
however, have tended to decrease of late years,
and it is estimated that at the present time there are
not more than fifty thousand in the country. Realising
the danger incurred by this diminution, the
Government is now taking measures towards the
protection of these very useful birds, and there is no
doubt that judicious legislation will cause their
number to increase once more.</p>

<p>The financial interest that England possesses in
Uruguay is not generally realised. As a matter of
fact, the amount of British capital invested in the
Banda Oriental amounts to over forty-four millions
of pounds sterling, and there are thus only two
nations, Argentina and Brazil, that possess a greater
share of the total of those funds invested in the
South American continent. To the ears of the
majority, it must be admitted, the names of Chile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Peru, Venezuela, and Colombia sound more familiar
than that of the country with which we are at present
dealing. Yet in the matter of these investments
Chile alone can approach the status of the small
Republic on the River Plate, and, indeed, falls behind
it only to the extent of a few hundred thousand
pounds. Peru, however, is interested to scarcely
more than one-half of the extent, while Venezuela,
the next in order, cannot lay claim to one-sixth of
the amount.</p>

<p>A comparison such as this will show the real
financial importance that Uruguay represents to
England, and, such being admitted, the condition
of its commerce must be a matter of proportionate
interest. To deal first of all with the general
commercial development of the country, the outlook
is undoubtedly satisfactory. In order to obtain the
broadest possible survey of the situation it is
necessary to lump together the national imports and
exports. Taking a recent number of five-yearly
periods, the results obtained are:</p>

<p>The dollar quoted in this table&mdash;and wherever this
unit is employed throughout the book&mdash;is, it should
be explained, the Uruguayan gold dollar, the rough
value of which may be estimated at four shillings
and twopence.</p>

<p>This steady development of commerce is not a little
striking in view of the fact that up to the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
only a very small percentage of the resources of
the country have been brought to bear. It is true
that the chief national wealth is likely, in the future
as in the past, to remain centred in the rich natural
grazing lands. But the progress of agriculture is
now such that this branch of industry cannot well
fail in the course of a few years to rank as a
moderate second in importance to the business of
grazing. Moreover, the development of this latter
itself is only now being proceeded with in a manner
worthy of the great resources that exist. The marked
increase in the general commerce that is evident
between the years 1899 and 1908 is due to a very
large extent to the introduction of modern methods
into the estancia life of the country.</p>

<p>It is necessary now to turn to a more detailed consideration
of Uruguay's exports. The chief of these,
as has already been explained, is represented by
live stock, and by meat in various forms. Of recent
years these particular branches of industry have been
undergoing a certain amount of transformation. For
generations, indeed for centuries, Uruguay has represented
the chief source of Brazil's supply of animal
food. Not only were the herds of cattle and flocks
of sheep driven northwards with ceaseless regularity
across the frontier, but the millions of bales of dried
beef flowed along the same channels too.</p>

<p>Recent events have caused a certain diminution in
this commerce. With the course of time Brazil has
become more and more desirous of seeing her own
southern and comparatively temperate provinces more
liberally stocked with cattle. With the idea of
fostering the local grazing industry, the northern
republic has increased the duties upon both imported
cattle and meat. The immediate result naturally
proved unfavourable both to Uruguayan graziers and
saladero owners. In the end, however, the outcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
has proved beneficial rather than detrimental to the
landowner. As may be imagined, for the manufacture
of tasajo a high grade of cattle is not
necessarily required. The secret of the actual quality
of the meat is to a great extent lost in the dried
and hardened bales of the preserve. Moreover, in
order to suit the taste of local consumption in Brazil
a far slenderer class of animal was necessary than the
fattened type that the colder climates demand.</p>

<p>Thus, when it became necessary to make up for
the deficit in these neighbourly exports by the opening
up of fresh markets and by catering for the overseas
demand, one of the first means to be taken in hand
towards attaining this end was a yet more close
attention to the question of a quality of meat suitable
for European consumption. There were many who
foresaw numerous difficulties in attaining to this
standard, principally owing to the comparative
absence of alfalfa in the land. It is true that this
fattening lucerne thrives only in limited areas of
Uruguay. But to what extent the excellent pastures
of the land have made up for this disadvantage is
plain enough from the amount of frozen carcasses
now shipped to Europe. The situation as regards
the export of pastoral products has, in consequence,
become improved. Less dried meat and fewer live
cattle are sent to Brazil, but the deficiency is more
than counterbalanced by shipments of a superior
order to the new markets now established in Europe.</p>

<p>The present situation of the meat markets throughout
the world has reached so vitally important a
stage that a few comments on the position cannot
well come amiss in view of its inevitable direct
influences upon Uruguay, and the similar stock-raising
countries. Naturally enough, the primary
centres of interest are to be found in the United
States, and in its Beef Trust. Ere coming to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
point, however, it would be as well to review the
general situation.</p>

<p>Until the present moment the British Isles have
been the chief importers of frozen and chilled meat
from both North and South America. The demand
has, naturally enough, shown an annual increase
corresponding with the growth of the population.
A similar state of affairs has, of course, existed in
North America, but here the increase of the inhabitants
has been so rapid and so overwhelming that
the breeding of cattle has been entirely unable to
progress in the same ratio. The result of this is
that the United States can now produce only a comparatively
insignificant surplus over and above the
quantity of animal food that is required for consumption
by its own inhabitants. Of late, therefore,
the shipments of North American beef to the British
Isles have decreased with a rather startling celerity,
and there can be no question that in the near future
the trade will have ceased altogether. Exactly when
this will occur&mdash;whether in two years or half a dozen&mdash;it
is impossible for even the experts to tell, since
so many elements of the unexpected enter into the
question. But that it will come about is certain,
and it is, of course, equally inevitable that the conclusion
of the period of exportation will mark the
beginning of another era when it will be necessary
for the United States to import her animal food
supply from countries outside her own frontiers.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Argentina has stepped into the
gap that North America had of necessity left vacant,
and the establishment of its frigorifico will now enable
Uruguay to take a hand in this business of shipping.
The River Plate countries are undoubtedly in a position
to cope with the situation for an indefinite period
of years, although its effects are already evident to
a certain extent upon the local markets of Argentina.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
In the latter country I have been present at the
stockyards in November when the herds of cattle that
had arrived from the Campo were being sold. The
faces of those estancieros who were present were
beaming, for prices were ruling quite exceptionally
high. The reason lay in the demand for the London
Christmas beef that had sent its stimulus all this
distance&mdash;an emphatic proof of the closeness of touch
that now obtains between the River Plate and the
British Isles.</p>

<p>Were the position to begin and end at this point
it would be simple enough. Some developments,
however, have occurred of late that render the outlook
for the future far more complicated. There seems
very little doubt that the time will come when
England will no longer enjoy the practical monopoly
of imported beef. The desire for the admission of
this commodity in several of the great European
countries is becoming more and more accentuated,
and it is highly probable that the agitation that is
now being carried on in favour of this new departure
will eventually result in the breaking down of the
barriers that at present oppose the trade. It is,
of course, impossible to estimate the full extent of
the consequences of a move of the kind, but that
it must cause a rise in the price of beef in the English
markets is inevitable.</p>

<p>In the face of these possibilities the prospects of
the River Plate countries are, of course, more favourable
than ever before. With the markets of Europe
open to their cattle and meat, the added stimulus
to the industries of these countries cannot fail to
be enormous. But here again an element has come
into being that, although it will have no effect upon
the industry, taken as a whole, must necessarily
threaten many of the interests involved. The Beef
Trust of the United States has been keenly alive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
to the great pastoral developments in South America.
Accurately foreseeing that the importance of the
present day is merely a prelude to what is to come,
the great corporation has now descended wholesale
upon the shores of the River Plate, has already
bought up a number of frigorificos, and it will be
through no want of endeavour of its own if it does
not sooner or later acquire the remainder.</p>

<p>I have no desire to tilt against the Beef Trust,
which is very probably an excellent institution, but
one that, since it openly lays no claim to a purely
philanthropical policy, cannot be expected to safeguard
the welfare of concerns that do not tend towards
its own advancement. Should this corporation,
therefore, attain its present object of securing the
frigorificos, and the consequent monopoly of the
purchase of cattle for export, the actual producers
of the live stock will find themselves face to face
with a situation of which they have previously had
no experience. It is quite possible that it will suit
the corporation to buy the cattle at prices similar
to those which now obtain&mdash;or it may not, since it
is well known that the estanciero continued to exist
in a more or less affluent fashion when his cattle sold
at lower rates than is the case at the present day.</p>

<p>In any case the matter seems to be taken fairly
lightly in the South American countries most concerned.
The prevalent idea is that, should the
danger be realised, it is easy to legislate against
trusts&mdash;a theory that may, or may not, be correct.
Putting aside for the moment, however, these possible
complications, it will be clear that the position of
the River Plate countries as regards the shipment
of their beef is quite exceptionally favourable. So
much so, indeed, that it is not without the bounds
of possibility that the spread of agriculture may at
some future period receive a check in favour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the purely pastoral industry. For the wheat and
maize-producing lands are considerably in excess of
those that raise cattle in sufficient quantities for
serious export. Fresh areas suitable for wheat-growing,
moreover, are continually being lit upon,
whereas the discovery of new grazing lands is
obviously more limited. It is true that our own
colony of Rhodesia promises to take an important
share in the cattle-breeding industry&mdash;a promise the
fulfilment of which may be anticipated with confidence.
With this exception, the countries of the
River Plate will undoubtedly hold the balance of
power in all matters appertaining to that very, very
important article beef.</p>

<p>In addition to that of the carcasses themselves,
another very important product of Uruguay is the
extract of meat produced by the Liebig (Lemco)
Company. Fray Bentos was the original home of
this industry, with which the place has been associated
since 1865. Of late years the Lemco interests have
spread far beyond their original frontiers, for of the
total of nearly five million acres at present owned
by the concern many hundred thousands of acres exist
in Argentina, Paraguay, and even in Rhodesia. As
a matter of fact, the working power of the recently
constructed factory at Colón in Entre Rios, upon
the Argentine bank of the river, exceeds that of
Fray Bentos. Nevertheless, the importance of this
latter place will be evident enough when it is
explained that in 1910 over one hundred and seventy-nine
thousand head of cattle were slaughtered there
in order to provide the necessary extract of meat.</p>

<p>The Lemco town of Fray Bentos is by way of
being a model specimen of its kind. The establishments
of the managers here, and the dwellings of
the workmen are each admirable of their kind, and
very replete with the comforts and luxuries that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
appertain to the various walks of life. The streets,
moreover, are broad and well-engineered, and the
schools and various institutions denote a liberal spirit
on the part of the directors of the concern.</p>

<p>To turn from the meat industry to that of agriculture,
we come, naturally enough, to a far less
imposing condition of affairs, but one, nevertheless,
that is increasing in importance each year. The chief
cereal of Uruguay is wheat. At the present moment
nearly three hundred thousand hectares have been
devoted to the raising of this crop. Although the
discovery of fresh lands suitable to the production
of wheat has caused this particular area to increase,
the main centres in cultivation up to the present have
been rather strictly localised. The provinces that
contain the really important wheat districts are those
of San José, Colonia, and Canelones. The lines of
railway, however, that have recently been constructed
to the east and west of the Republic are opening
up much land that is undoubtedly admirably suited
for the production of this cereal. Wheat, it may
be explained, is a crop the nature of which renders
it more immune than the majority from the attacks
of the voracious locust. By the time the all-devouring
insect is wont to make its appearance, the ears of
the wheat are as a rule hardened to a sufficient extent
to render them unpalatable. Wheat therefore, frequently
escapes, wholly or in part, where the maize
crop suffers severely from the ravages of the locusts.</p>

<p>The production of maize is only very slightly less
than that of wheat. The yield of this commodity
in 1909 amounted roughly to one hundred and seventy
thousand tons, while that of wheat fell just below
two hundred and thirty-four thousand tons. Generally
speaking, it may be said that the districts where
wheat is grown are suitable for the cultivation of
maize, and thus in Uruguay the two are wont to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
flourish to a large extent side by side. It is worthy
of note, however, that whereas the wheat area has
remained more or less stationary, although its
development is now practically certain, that of
maize has increased to a marked extent&mdash;from
one hundred and forty-five thousand hectares, in fact,
in 1900 to over two hundred thousand hectares
in 1909.</p>

<p>The production of oats and barley&mdash;although that
of either still remains comparatively insignificant&mdash;has
increased rapidly during the past decade. In
1900 the output of oats only just exceeded thirty
tons, whereas in 1909 it had amounted to nearly
seven thousand tons. Barley has a similar, although
a somewhat more gradual, tale to tell, since in the
corresponding period its production rose from four
hundred to three thousand tons.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that Uruguayan minerals may
yet cause something of a sensation throughout the
world. In the past her deposits of the kind have
lain comparatively undisturbed, owing to similar
reasons that have hampered the industry in Peru
and Bolivia&mdash;want of transport facilities. With the
rapid spread of the railways, however, these disadvantages
will shortly become minimised, when no
doubt considerably more will be heard of the mineral
wealth of the country.</p>

<p>Let it be clear that I am not making the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
remarks in the character of a mining expert. The
latter profession, according to vulgar report, is at
times not averse to fiction; but the gap that separates
an author from a goldfield is uncomfortably wide.
This apparently frivolous foreword is not altogether
uncalled for, since to speak with undue optimism of
the presence of the yellow dross is dangerous to the
layman writer, and profitable only to the expert.
Nevertheless, the auriferous prospects of Uruguay,
so far as such can ever be assured, give no small
promise of success.</p>

<p>The chief goldfields of Uruguay lie in the northern
province of Rivera, and are situated in the neighbourhoods
of Corrales, Cuñapiru, and Zapucaya. A
district here of from thirty-five to forty miles in
length and of about seven miles in breadth is thickly
interwoven with auriferous reef. The knowledge of
the wealth in this particular spot is no new thing,
as ancient superficial workings on the part of the
Indians prove. From that time the mines had
apparently fallen into disuse until comparatively
recent years, when they were in a sense rediscovered
by a French company. The concern, it is true, met
with a consistent lack of prosperity. The actual
working is said to have been carried on in a fashion
that was both half-hearted and old-fashioned. The
period, moreover, was a peculiarly disturbed one
from a political point of view, and the province of
Rivera has always been famed as the birthplace and
chosen haunt of revolutionary movements. An
English company, however, has now assumed control
of the mines, a modern plant is at work, and gold
is actually being yielded.</p>

<p>Such are the bare historical facts of the chief
mines at Corrales. According to the experts, reefs
have been met with that will yield five ounces to
the ton, and, should the reefs prove deep, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
prospects are practically limitless. But this remains
to be seen. In the meanwhile the earth has
promised! But its promises, like its crust in parts,
are sometimes of pielike material. In this case,
should the anticipations be realised, there will be
no little stir in the province of Rivera&mdash;and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of these mines are enormous
deposits of manganese that are just now beginning
to attract special attention. The quantities of iron,
too, that are to be met with here are rather exceptional.
Rivera, however, constitutes by no means
the sole mineral district of Uruguay. The provinces
of Minas, Artigas, Maldonado, Salto, Paysandú,
Montevideo, and San José are all more or less well
endowed with the various species.</p>

<p>Of these remaining centres Minas is probably the
richest. Traces of gold are to be met with here,
although in a minor degree, and silver, copper,
marble, gypsum, slate, sulphur, and asbestos would
probably all repay organised handling. Minas also
produces lead, but this, too, has suffered from considerable
neglect. Indeed, I believe that one of the
very few ransackings of the mines that have occurred
was for the purpose of manufacturing bullets for
the armies during the revolutionary and civil wars
at the beginning of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The province of Maldonado contains copper, iron,
marble, gypsum, sulphur, and slate, and here, too, the
mineral field has remained almost unexploited up to
the present. Montevideo holds manganese and iron,
Salto copper, Florida iron, Paysandú copper, and
San José asbestos. These, at all events, constitute
the principal centres of the minerals specified,
although there are others of comparative insignificance
in many other districts.</p>

<p>Uruguay, too, is by no means without its precious
stones. Odd rubies and diamonds have been met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
with from time to time, and the jasper and agate
are fairly common. The stones, however, that obtain
in really considerable numbers, and that are consequently
of the chief commercial interest, are the
amethyst and the topaz. Of both these some magnificent
specimens are to be met with in the Province
of Artigas. These very handsome stones are now
attaining a distinct popularity amongst the visitors
to Montevideo. To those who have not the opportunity
of visiting the remote province of Artigas itself,
it may be mentioned that Agosto Wild, in the Calle
Veinte Cinco de Mayo in Montevideo, is a most
trustworthy and reliable dealer.</p>

<p>A peculiarity of Uruguay is the water-stone that
is met with in the neighbourhood of Salto. This
consists of a rounded portion of stone, more or less
knobbly and opaque or smooth and transparent as
the case may be. In the latter the water that is
enclosed within it is almost as plainly seen as though
it were held within rather dull glass, and with every
movement of the crystal-like material the motion and
bubblings of the water are very clearly evident.
There have been some mental gymnastics ere now
concerning the advent of the apple within the
dumpling: but the presence of this water within
the stone suffices to puzzle the more scientific minds.
So far as I am aware, no adequate explanation of
the phenomenon has yet been vouchsafed.</p>

<p>Viticulture is one of the more recent industries of
Uruguay. It has now, however, obtained a firm
hold, and the future of the commerce is distinctly
promising. It was as late as 1860 that the first
tentative plantings of the vine occurred, and it was
not until 1875 that a couple of really important
vineyards were established, one at Colon and the
other at Salto, in the north-west of the republic.
Even then the undertaking did not meet with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
immediate success, and it was some while ere the
type of plant was discovered that would lead to the
most favourable results in the local soil.</p>

<p>This, however, once discovered, the progress of
viticulture has proceeded almost without a check.
The rapidity of its increase may be gathered from
the following figures. In 1880 the number of vineyards
in Uruguay was 16; in 1890, 181; whereas
in 1895 the total had swollen to 748. Since that
time the industry has continued to spread. Thus
in 1897 the vineyards had increased in number to
824, while in 1905 the viticultural census showed
the very respectable total of 1,453.</p>

<p>It is only natural that this great increase in vineyards
should have been accompanied by the introduction
of a greater variety of suitable plants. The types
of vines that now flourish in Uruguay hail from
France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Germany, the
importance of the various kinds being in accordance
with the seniority rendered them in order here. Of
the French species introduced the most popular are
the Sauvignon, Cabernet, Pinot Noir, Castel, Merlot,
Verdot, Semillon, Sauvignon blanc, Clairette blanche,
and some half-dozen others; of the Italian the
Piamonte, Grignolino Negro, Asprino, Docetto,
Leonarda, Lambrusca, Cipro Negro, and Verdea.
The favourite Spanish varieties are the Cariñana,
Morrastel Bouchet, Murviedo, Malvosia Blanca, Pedro
Ximinez, while from Portugal have been introduced
the black and the white grape, and from Germany
the Riesling.</p>

<p>The cultivation of the vineyards is attended by
the greatest expense in the south of the country,
where the comparatively humid climate lends itself
more readily to the propagation of the various
diseases to which the vine is subject. Here the
American grape, owing to its immunity from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
phyloxera in a great degree, flourishes admirably.
The departments in which viticulture is chiefly carried
on are at Montevideo, that possesses a vineyard area
of 1,426 hectares; Salto, 719 hectares; Canelones,
699 hectares; Colonia, 490 hectares; Maldonado,
330 hectares; Paysandú, 177 hectares; Florida,
132 hectares; Soriano, 125 hectares; and Artigas,
97 hectares. In the remaining departments the
viticultural industry is of small account.</p>

<p>The later increase in the actual production of
grapes and wine will be evident from the following

<p>The sealing industry of Uruguay is of considerably
greater importance than is generally supposed. Mr.
C. E. R. Rowland, the British Consul at Montevideo,
is the leading English authority on the subject. The
following article, then, which he has kindly supplied,
may be taken as authoritative:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The aboriginal races of this part of South America
were known to have resorted to the coast-line during
the summer months for their fishing expeditions, the
Indian race of the Charrúas occupying the coastline
from above the river town of Colonia to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
borders of the Brazilian frontier at al Chue, on the
Atlantic.</p>

<p>Traces of their encampment grounds are still to
be found along this coast, principally from Maldonado
to the Brazilian frontier, where many of
their primitive weapons and utensils are still to be
met with, and also the remains of what must have
been their watch-fires, mounds of burnt bones, containing
amongst the rest bones and teeth of seals
which crumble under touch.</p>

<p>This coast in these former times evidently
abounded in seal life, as the natural conditions
offered every attraction to these now timid animals.
A storm-beaten coast, with plentiful havens, in the
mouth of a large estuary abounding with fish, enticed
the seals to the shore and made them an easy prey
to the Indians, but time has driven them to the
present rookeries which now afford them protection.</p>

<p>The first record of the sealing industry on the
coast of Uruguay having been put to practical
purposes is that in the year 1834 they were rented
by the Government for the period of ten years to
Señor Francisco Aguilar for the sum of $80,000.
The condition was imposed that he should erect a
suitable edifice to be used as a public school in the
town of Maldonado. This latter condition was
altered insomuch that the building, when completed,
was used as a chapel, and has remained so ever
since.</p>

<p>From the termination of this contract up to the
year 1858 this industry was worked by various
tenants, but in this latter year the Government
passed a Law imposing a tax of 20 centavos per
skin and 4 centavos per 10 kilos of seal oil, to
be paid in equal proportions to the municipalities
of Maldonado and Rocha Departments, on whose
coasts the islands are situated. A further Law in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the year 1896 doubled these taxes, which were
destined by the said Law to be applied by the
municipal authorities to the public works and the
creation of artificial parks.</p>

<p>The islands inhabited by seals on the coast of
Uruguay are:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="seals">
<tr><td align="left">Castillos Rocks</td><td align="left">4 small islands</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">Lobos</td><td align="left">2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The Castillos Rocks are very difficult of access
on account of the heavy swell breaking on them.
The Polonio group consists of three small islands
lying directly off the cape of same name, and are
called Raza, Encantado, and De Marco.</p>

<p>The sealers' huts and boiling-house are on the
mainland in a small bay to the north-east of the
lighthouse. The seals when killed on these islands
are skinned with the inside lining of fat attached
and are brought on shore, when the inside lining
of fat is taken off and boiled down. The dead
carcasses are left on the island, and in my opinion
the presence of so many dead seals destroyed by
human agency must have some effect upon those
animals frequenting these islands, making them wary
and cautious in returning again to a place where
the remains of their companions are so visible.</p>

<p>Coronilla Islands consist of two large islands,
covered with herbage, and one small "<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">islote</i>," or
reef, generally awash with the sea.</p>

<p>On the largest of these islands the sealers live
during the season for the purpose of salting the skins
and boiling down the carcass of the seals for oil.
At the end of the season the skins and oil are brought
into Montevideo by tug-boats.</p>

<p>On Lobos Islands the killing is carried out in a
different manner. A large corral is erected on the
middle of the island, and, when seals are plentiful
and the wind and weather are specially favourable,
a drive is made by about fifty men with clubs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
who, getting between the seals and the sea,
drive them gently towards the corral. This is
done without much difficulty, and perhaps two
thousand may be enclosed in one day. Once
enclosed they are allowed to wait until all preparations
for killing are complete. They are then driven
out in batches of twenty or thirty to the skinning-shed
and boiler-house, where they are dispatched
at leisure.</p>

<p>By this mode of killing I am inclined to think
that there must be a great waste of seal life from
an absence of a proper knowledge as regards the
animal killed. No selection is made from those
driven down, and every animal is killed even if the
skin is worthless or mangy. The majority of the
animals slaughtered are females, consequently the
stock of production is gradually lessened. Were
a skilled sealer employed for the proper classification
of the animals before killing, it would
do away to some extent with the extermination
of seals whose skins at that season were practically
worthless.</p>

<p>On the Paloma Islands very few seals are killed.</p>

<p>The seizure of the Canadian schooner <em>Agnes G.
Donohoe</em> in the year 1905 on the alleged grounds
of sealing in jurisdictional waters&mdash;that is, within the
three miles limit&mdash;caused the intervention of the
British Government. The master and men were
under arrest for a period of ten months, but
the case, diplomatically handled at that time by
her Majesty's Representative, Mr. Walter Baring
(Minister), and Mr. Robert Peel (Chargé d'Affaires),
was finally settled with satisfaction to both Governments
by the tactful procedure of his Majesty's
present Representative, Mr. Robert J. Kennedy,
Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary.</p>

<p>British enterprise throughout South America is
admittedly remarkable. If one except the retail and
local trades that are carried on by the native-born
inhabitants of each republic, or by the Spaniards,
Basques, Italians, and Turks, each of which have
taken some particular trade under their own protection,
there is probably not a single branch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
industry in which the British are not interested in
a more or less important degree.</p>

<p>From mining and banking to farming and general
commerce, the scope is sufficiently broad. In no
other kind of enterprise, however, has intelligence
and skill been so freely lavished as upon that of
the railways. The British have not the sole monopoly
of these great undertakings, it is true. There are
the local Government lines, numerous French railways,
and others of various nationalities that are
ably served and administered. Yet almost every one
of the most important lines throughout the entire
Southern continent owes its existence to British
capital, and is managed by British officials. The
record is a remarkable one, and the full tale of
its magnitude has yet to be written. It is true that
in many branches of industry the ratio of British
increase has not been in proportion with that of
other countries&mdash;a falling off that may be inevitable,
but that in any case is regrettable. Fortunately,
this is not the case with the railways. Indeed, when
the progress that is now being made is taken into
consideration, it becomes evident that the results that
must ensue within the space of a few years cannot
well fail to affect the entire world.</p>

<p>Of the feats of this kind that are at the present
moment being achieved some of the most important
are concerned with Bolivia, Paraguay, and the hinterland
of Brazil. The opening up of many of the
hitherto inaccessible regions of these countries means
more than the enclosing within the fold of civilisation
vast areas of rubber, timber, and general agriculture.
It promises, in fact, some revelations in
the way of minerals and mines that, although the
possibility of a disappointment must never be lost
sight of, are likely enough to prove of an astonishing
nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The tales of gold in the untravelled lands where
the Indian still holds sway do undoubtedly not
emanate merely from the imagination of the few
travellers who have penetrated within certain of the
districts. The reluctance of the aboriginal to disclose
the spots from which they derive the precious metal
is an acknowledged phase of his character. But it
is not solely upon the unwilling testimony of the
Indians that such hopes are based. It is well enough
known that when the expulsion of the Jesuits
occurred, and when many of the remoter districts
in which they had established precarious missions
returned to a state of savagery and seclusion, numbers
of the mines that were even then known were abandoned
when in the full flush of their yield&mdash;a yield
that the primitive native implements could never
make complete.</p>

<p>But it is not in anticipation of such developments
as these that the railways have been built. The
ordinary products of the countries in question are
more than sufficient to demand their existence. The
possibility of greater mineral fields than are at
present suspected is merely a side issue in the
general scheme. The influence of steam transport,
however, upon many of the silver-mines cannot fail
to be marked, since the utter want of transport
facilities now renders imperative an astonishing
number of mines of this kind the productive power
of which is very great indeed.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan railways form no exception to the
prevailing South American rule. The three companies
in existence in that Republic are all British,
and the standard of each is as high as that of the
others in the remaining republics. Although the
enterprises naturally enjoy lesser advantages in the
way of skilled labour and technical conveniences than
those here at home, there can be no doubt that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
degree of comfort enjoyed by the traveller on a
Uruguayan line compares very favourably with that
experienced on an average British railway. The
service and observation of punctuality are both to
be commended, while the dining and sleeping cars
are not only admirable of their type, but extremely
well adapted to the needs of the country.</p>

<p>The natural facilities that the Uruguayan country
offers for railways differ considerably from those of
the Argentine. In the central provinces of the
latter many hundreds of miles may be travelled
without any gradient whatever becoming apparent.
The absence of streams here, moreover, obviates
almost entirely the necessity for bridge building.
It has already been explained that the characteristics
of the Uruguayan Campo are entirely different.
Although it possesses few hills of any really imposing
height, its stretches of dead level ground are
equally rare. Thus, although the gradients may be
gentle and sufficiently easy, they are almost continuous.
In some places, moreover, the rise and
fall of the line is necessarily accentuated, and even
abrupt&mdash;at all events, compared with the neighbouring
areas.</p>

<p>Although, however, Uruguay may not be quite so
favourably situated for railway purposes as regards
its levels, it possesses one very important advantage
over Argentina. In the central and richest provinces
of the latter one of the most serious drawbacks lies
in the total absence of any local material with which
to ballast the track. For hundreds of miles on all
sides no stone&mdash;not even the merest pebble&mdash;is to
be met with, since the land consists of nothing beyond
the rich, alluvial soil. Thus, if stone be required
for the perfection of the tracks, it is necessary to
import it from afar, and the haulage of the material
inevitably forms a weighty item in the cost and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
upkeep of the line. In this respect Uruguay is far
more favourably provided for. Stone abounds, not
only in certain districts but throughout the country&mdash;although,
of course, there are many centres where
the quality of the material is far superior to that
of others. Thus the question of ballast and embankments
is solved in a very simple fashion here, and
in a land of numerous rivers and streams the
construction of stone bridges is made possible.</p>

<p>As regards the present position of Uruguayan railways,
it is impossible to over-estimate the importance
of the new ramifications that are now spreading
through the country. Uruguay contains no
mysterious hinterland, it is true. But, although
every corner of the Republic is known, the resources
of many of its regions have of necessity remained
quite untapped for want of the railway communication
that was essential for the transport of the
produce in whatever shape or form it might emerge
from the soil.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Mr. V. Hinde, the secretary of
the Midland Uruguay Railway, for the following
information concerning the railways of the country:</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The construction of railways in Uruguay may be
said to have commenced in the year 1866, when
a concession was granted for a line from the capital
(Montevideo) to Durazno, a distance of 130 miles.
The construction of this line was followed by the
building of a short line from the city of Salto towards
the frontier of Brazil. In 1877 an English company,
the present Central Uruguay Railway Co.,
Ltd., was formed to take over the former and
complete the line to the town of Rio Negro, which
extension was finished in 1886.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Uruguayan Government had
devoted considerable attention to the question of railways,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and in the year 1884 a law was passed by
the Chambers embodying a definite scheme of railway
communication with various parts of the Republic,
the executive being authorised to contract for lines
as outlined, and to guarantee an income equal to
£560 per annum per mile of line for a period of
forty years. A result of this enactment was the
formation of several companies in England, and railway
construction was rapidly proceeded with. By
the year 1891, 1,000 miles of line were opened for
traffic. In respect of which some 670 miles enjoyed
the Government guarantee, equal to 7 per cent. on
a capitalisation of £5,000 per kilometre.</p>

<p>At this point, however, further development received
a check by the Government finding it necessary
to rearrange its obligations. This rearrangement
took the form of a reduction of the interest on the
External Debt, including railway guarantees, from
7 per cent. to 3<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> per cent., the service at this reduced
figure being secured on 45 per cent. of the Custom
House receipts specially hypothecated. Punctual
payment of guarantees at this rate has always been
made.</p>

<p>In 1889 the Central Uruguay Western Extension
Railway Company was formed to construct a line
from San José to the towns of Mercedes, Sauce,
and Colonia. This line does not enjoy a Government
guarantee, and reverts to the Government in
the year 1862.</p>

<p>The railway system of the Republic to-day amounts
to some 1,432 miles of line opened for traffic and
78 miles in course of construction.</p>

<p><em>Central Company.</em>&mdash;By far the most important
system is that of the Central Company, including
leased and worked lines. The lines of this system
extend from the capital to the frontier of Brazil
at Rivera, with branches to the city of Mercedes in
the west, and the towns of Melo, Treinta y Tres,
and Minas on the Eastern and North-Eastern Extension.
The railway from the capital passes through
a well-populated agricultural district for a radius
of about thirty miles; this radius is gradually
extending, stimulated by the increasing importance
of Montevideo and the gradual breaking up of lands
in the fertile regions of the western and eastern
extensions.</p>

<p>The extension now finished to Melo opens up
another district suitable to the cultivation of cereals,
from which considerable traffic is being derived.</p>

<p>An extremely important matter in connection with
the future development of these lines, and, in fact,
all the railway interests of the Republic, is to be
found in the completion of the port works at Montevideo.
Until the port works were taken in hand
the embarkation of cargo at this principal outlet
of the Republic had been greatly hampered by natural
difficulties, and consequently heavy charges in connection
with the lighterage from the railway wharf
to the ocean steamers. The deepening of the inner
port and the construction of extensive wharfs and
piers at which ocean steamers can berth will doubtless
lead to an increase in traffic, not only from Uruguay
but the neighbouring State of Rio Grande do Sul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>An important connection with the railway system
of Rio Grande do Sul is made at the terminus of
the Central Uruguay Northern Extension Railway
at Rivera, and by the completion of a connecting
link between the Sao Paulo Rio Grande Railway
System and the lines of the Cie Auxiliare de Chemins
de Fer au Bresil, a Company which controls practically
the whole railway system of the State of
Rio Grande do Sul (now almost completed), direct
railway communication will be established between
Montevideo and Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>The following table shows the result of working
of the Central Uruguay Main Line, exclusive of
extensions, which, as far as expansion in receipts
is concerned, may be regarded as indicative of those
lines:</p>

<p>The increase in gross receipts is perhaps not quite
so marked as in the case of neighbouring lines in
the Argentine Republic, and a reason for this is
to be found in the fact that, favoured by magnificent
grazing camps, cattle raising is still the principal
industry of Uruguay. Agricultural development,
although more marked of recent years, has been
slow, but an increase in this is probably due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
efforts which are being made by the Government
to promote colonisation and the extension of lines
in the Eastern provinces.</p>

<p><em>Midland Uruguay Railway.</em>&mdash;This Company's line
passes through an entirely pastoral district, and its
traffic is principally derived from the carriage of
cattle, wool, and general merchandise. An important
extension is now practically completed to Fray
Bentos, the headquarters of Liebig's Extract of Meat
Company. The River Uruguay at this point is
navigable for large ocean steamers, and a pier has
been erected to accommodate these, which will put
the railway system of the north of the Republic in
a more favourable position to handle the various
products of cattle-killing establishments, both in
Uruguay and on the Brazilian side of the frontier
of Rio Grande do Sul, an industry of increasing
importance.</p>

<p>At the present time a considerable tonnage is
transported by river from Salto for shipment from
Buenos Aires. It is possible, therefore, that the
extension of the Midland Company to Fray Bentos
will play an important part in the development of
its line and those of the companies north of Salto,
and Fray Bentos should very shortly become the
second port of the Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>The receipts in Uruguay of the Midland Company
have shown some expansion of late years, having
increased from £55,000 in the year ending June 30,
1904, to £88,165 in 1909-10 (see opposite page).</p>

<p><em>The North-Western of Uruguay Railway and
Uruguay Northern Railway.</em>&mdash;The remarks with
regard to the nature of the country and the traffic
of the Midland apply also to these lines. At the
terminus of the North-Western Line at the River
Cuareim arrangements exist for the interchange of
traffic with the Brazil Great Southern Railway, and
the respective Governments have sanctioned a project
for the construction of an international bridge to
connect the lines at this point. It is probable that
this bridge will be constructed within the next few
years, as the interchange of traffic due to the extension
of the Brazil Great Southern Railway to San
Borju is likely to be considerably enhanced.</p>

<p>The excellent tramways with which Montevideo
is served are administered by three companies, local,
British, and German. The local enterprise is considerably
the smallest of the three, the extent of
its lines not exceeding twelve miles. The concern,
moreover, is dependent solely upon horse traction,
with its attendant disadvantages.</p>

<p>The British enterprise, the United Electric Tramway
Company, is the most important in the capital.
It possesses eighty-two miles of line, 195 passenger-cars,
and sixty-eight trailers. By the terms of the
concession at least two-thirds of the employees must
be citizens of the country. The Compania Alemania
Transatlantia is a German Company, with a length
of seventy-five miles of electric tramlines.</p>

<p>The steamer service of the River Plate and
Uruguay is almost entirely in the hands of the
Mihanovich Company, as, indeed, is that of the entire
system of these great rivers. The Company is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
extremely powerful one, possessing a very large fleet
that comprises all classes of steam vessels from the
small, puffing tug to the largest and most modern
liner of the fresh waters. Many of these latter are
peculiarly fine specimens of their type, graceful in
build, powerfully equipped, and provided with broad
and roomy decks. Although the larger of these
craft will carry between two and three hundred
passengers, the cabin and saloon accommodation
is contrived on a most liberal and imposing scale.
Indeed, there is no doubt that the Mihanovich
boats are a credit to the broad rivers on which
they float.</p>

<p>So far as the ocean passenger traffic is concerned,
Montevideo is the sole Uruguayan port at which the
liners call. The capital affords a port of call for
the magnificent vessels of the Royal Mail Steam
Packet Company that, notwithstanding their size, are
now enabled by means of the recent harbour improvements
to enter the inner waters of the port.
Of the other British lines concerned, the most
important are the Pacific (that is now incorporated
with the R.M.S.P.) and the Nelson Line, that
possesses a fine new fleet of ten-thousand-ton boats.
The other great British shipping companies whose
vessels call at Montevideo are the Lamport and Holt,
Houlder, Prince, Houston, the New Zealand Shipping
Company, and the Shaw, Savill.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that in all monumental undertakings
of the kind the British are holding their
own in a satisfactory fashion. As regards ordinary
commerce and the exports of manufactured goods,
the progress, unfortunately, is by no means so
evident. I have so frequently laid stress upon the
narrowness of the home commercial ideas in this
respect that still obtains in so many quarters that
I am glad to be able to quote the words of another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
that admirably fit the case. The following is from
the Consular Report on Uruguay issued in 1910,
and the sentences undoubtedly sum up the situation
with a commendable accuracy: "It has been pointed
out to me that careful investigation into the commercial
methods of our competitors reveals several
reasons why British trade has failed to retain the
proportion of the imports it held a few years ago.
For instance, greater attention to detail is paid by
the foreign merchant than by his British rival, who,
as a rule, adheres in catalogues and invoices to British
standard weights and measures and prices, without
giving their equivalent in terms of the country. In
tenders for public works German firms study the
specifications with minute care, and tender for every
item, leaving nothing in doubt, besides drawing up
their applications in so clear and simple a manner
as to give the minimum labour in examination, and
the maximum of facility in comparison to the authorities
who deal with them; whereas British tenderers
sometimes merely quote a lump sum, ignoring all
details, and often, when details are given, the price
of many items is left vague, 'As may be agreed
upon.' When goods are imported into the country
from Germany, France, the United States of America,
&amp;c., a detailed statement in Spanish of the contents
of each package is generally furnished, with metric
weights and measures, which facilitates their rapid
examination and dispatch, whereas British firms as
a rule content themselves with the brief statement,
'Case containing machinery' or 'hardware,' &amp;c.,
leaving to the Custom House official the task of
working out details and calculations.</p>

<p>"Then, again, as regards languages, the British
commercial traveller, armed with British catalogues
and price lists [although I note with pleasure that
some are now printed in Spanish], knows no language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
but his own, but the German invariably speaks
Spanish and English, and he has carefully studied
beforehand the needs of the market which he is
visiting and the financial position of merchants. This
gives him a great advantage over his British rival,
who rarely has previous knowledge of his would-be
customers, and is dependent on such chance information
as he may pick up to be subsequently confirmed
by inquiries at the banks. Time is thus lost, and
irritation is caused to respectable buyers, who resent
what appears to them impertinent suspicion."</p>

<p>The Constitution of Uruguay has now stood the test
of eighty years, and thus claims to be the oldest in
South America, or, at all events, the one that has
suffered no modification for the longest period of
time. The basis on which this is composed is liberal
in the extreme, and the laws undoubtedly concede to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Oriental subjects an amount of freedom that can be
surpassed in few other countries.</p>

<p>The Republic possesses two chambers, one of
deputies elected by the direct vote of the people, the
other of senators. In addition to their legislative
functions it is the duty of these chambers to elect
the President of the nation, whose term of office lasts
for four years. The chambers also nominate the
judges of the High Court, who, in turn, select the
magistrates of the lower courts.</p>

<p>The civil code is largely based upon the Napoleonic
model. It may be as well to note rapidly a few of its
more salient features. From the point of view of the
resident foreigner it is admirable in at least one
respect, since it makes no distinction between the
civil rights accorded to Uruguayans and those to
foreigners. Civil marriage is obligatory, the offspring
of a union contracted solely by the Church
being considered illegitimate. In commerce the
system of arrest for debt is not admitted, the only
cases of the kind in which imprisonment is imposed
being those in which an element of fraud has
entered. In criminal law the death penalty has been
abolished, and the various modes of punishment
consist of solitary imprisonment, exile, deprivations,
suspension from public employment, ordinary imprisonment,
and fines.</p>

<p>On the whole, there is a satisfactory absence of
red-tape in Uruguayan administrative and municipal
affairs. It is true that in litigation the delays are
occasionally lengthy; but the popular idea on this
point has been much exaggerated, and the dispatch
of legal business is far more satisfactory than is
generally supposed. The great majority of officials,
moreover, discharge their duties in a reasonable and
fair-minded fashion that has been heartily acknowledged
by many a resident foreigner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>Uruguay possesses comparatively few paupers.
Indeed, it would be strange were this otherwise in a
land the resources of which are in excess of the
population. Nevertheless a certain proportion of
the lame, blind, halt, and indigent is inevitable,
and these unfortunate human elements are well cared
for. Public assistance towards this end is chiefly
in the hands of a Commission of Charity and Public
Welfare, formed of twenty-one members, two-thirds
of whom must be citizens of the Republic.</p>

<p>The powers of this Commission are considerable,
and they control a number of important institutions,
such as hospitals, orphan asylums, and establishments
of refuge for the infirm, indigent, and insane. These
are, almost without exception, exceedingly well-organised,
and conducted on the most modern
humanitarian lines. The financial support necessary
for the upkeep of these charities is derived to a
large extent from rates and taxes. In addition to this
a special lottery has been instituted that is known
as the "Charity Hospital Lottery." Twenty-five per
cent. of its proceeds are devoted to the institution in
question. The support at present derived from this
source is not inconsiderable, as will be evident when
it is explained that the amount it rendered in 1809
exceeded eight hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>We now arrive at the political affairs of Uruguay&mdash;a
subject that calls for explanation at some length.
So far as the distribution of parties is concerned,
the matter is simple enough. Shifting parties, fusions
and splits between contending sections, and the
general complications that attend changing political
programmes are to all intents and purposes absent
here. The rival parties of Uruguay are the Colorados
(reds) and the Blancos (whites). The policy of
both is equally well-defined, and, indeed, is amazingly
simple. It is to govern! The national programme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
would almost certainly remain exactly the same
whichever were in power. Thus the aim of the party
that is "out" is to obtain power in the first place,
and to declare their policy of government afterwards.</p>

<p>The feud between the parties is one of old-standing.
It commenced with the final wars of liberation,
became strongly marked with the establishment
of the Republic over eighty years ago, and has
continued without intermission from that day to this.
The origin of the party terms dates from the war
of liberation. General Oribe was the founder of the
Blanco party and General Rivera that of the
Colorado. The former was wont to ride a white
horse, the latter a bay, and the distinguishing colours
of the lance pennons of their followers were respectively
white and red.</p>

<p>It is a little curious to consider that the present-day
party strife in Uruguay is the direct legacy
of the disputes between these two generals that broke
out in the first instance ere the Banda Oriental had
even been proclaimed a nation! In 1830 Rivera
was elected first Constitutional President of the
Republic; he was succeeded on March 1, 1835, by
his rival, Manuel Oribe, and in 1838 there broke
out what is known as the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Grande Guerra</i>, which
lasted, with varying results, until 1852. In 1853 a
triumvirate was formed, consisting of Rivera,
Lavalleja, and Flores, and in the following year the
last named, on the death of his two colleagues, was
elected Constitutional President. Since that time
there have been no less than twenty-three presidents,
constitutional and provisional, of whom only two,
Perreira and Berro, from 1856 to 1864, have been
Blancos. In that year the Colorado party got into
office, and have maintained themselves, in spite of
the forcible efforts of the Blancos to expel them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen that no political principle divides
the two parties; men are simply Blanco or Colorado
because their fathers and grandfathers were so before
them, but they cling to their respective parties with
a strange courage and high sense of honour. In the
case of foreign immigrants whose sons, born in the
country, become Oriental subjects, but who have
no Blanco or Colorado traditions to inherit, what
happens is this: the youths go to school, form
boyish friendships, and by pure accident become
ardent supporters of one or other of the two parties.
Two brothers may thus chance to become bitter
political opponents, and when a revolution breaks
out they are to be found fighting on opposite sides.
The situation may savour a little of the Gilbertian,
but it is sufficiently serious for the families involved.
It must be admitted that many revolutions in Uruguay
are curious affairs. To one not in close touch with
the national movements an outbreak of the kind may
appear to burst forth spontaneously, whereas it has
probably been anticipated by the Government as well
as by the revolutionaries for months beforehand. In
these days even the most casual insurrection is not to
be effected without a certain amount of forethought.
First of all financial sinews are indispensable, and,
these once obtained, it follows that a supply of arms
is equally essential.</p>

<p>The introduction of these is the most difficult feat
of all to accomplish, since the Government adopts
methods of precaution, and keeps a sharp look-out for
any possible importations of the kind. Thus as a rule
the weapons are either smuggled across the Brazilian
frontier or over some of the more lonely stretches
of the River Uruguay. Occasionally a device is tried
similar to that which met with success in the
Transvaal Colony previous to the South African War.
When I was in Uruguay at the end of 1910 many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
indications were at hand that went to prove the
imminence of a revolution, and the authorities, not
only in Uruguay but in the neighbouring countries,
were on the alert for any development that might
arise. At this period a large number of innocent-looking
packing-cases, purporting to contain Manchester
goods, were in transit through Argentina
destined for one of the northern Oriental ports on
the Uruguay River. Through some cause or other
the cases came under suspicion, and they were opened
ere they had crossed the Argentine frontier. In
place of the Manchester goods reposed thousands of
grim Mauser rifles and millions of cartridges! The
discovery of these weapons must have dealt a bitter
blow to the insurrectionist cause; nevertheless, as
anticipated, the revolution broke out a few weeks
later.</p>

<p>I have said that both weapons and cash are
essential for the purpose of a revolution&mdash;which is
obvious enough in almost every country as well as
in Uruguay. But there is a third requisite that is
quite as indispensable as either of the former. The
Uruguayan is a born cavalryman, and a horse is
necessary to him, not only for the partaking in the
actions but for the covering of the lengthy distances
that have to be traversed. A score of leagues and
more frequently lie between a man and his appointed
rendezvous. A pedestrian in the midst of the hills
and valleys would be a lost and negligible unit.</p>

<p class="etc">

</p>

</div>

<p>It might be imagined that the matter was simple
enough, and that all a revolutionist had to do when
the time for the outbreak arrived was to mount his
horse, and to ride away over the hills to join his
fellows. In actual fact a rising is not to be started
in this fashion. It is inevitable in the first place
that numerous preparations must occur ere the time
for active operations has ripened, and it is equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
inevitable that an organisation of the kind, with
whatever attempt at secrecy it may be conducted,
cannot proceed without becoming known to the
Government.</p>

<p>The eve of an outbreak is, in consequence, marked
by tremendous vigilance on the part of the authorities.
Troopers and police are dispatched to strategic
positions throughout the country, and then for a while
the nation waits in anxious expectation while the
tension increases. With the first hint of the actual
banding together of the revolutionary companies the
authorities strike a blow&mdash;not at the men themselves,
but at their means of transport. The troopers and
police ride hastily in all directions, and scour the
countryside in search of every horse that is available.
When the districts have been swept quite clear of
their equine population the horses are driven together
to the various headquarters, where they remain,
strongly guarded.</p>

<p>This very practical measure naturally provides the
authorities with a power with which it is difficult for
the revolutionists to cope. It is distinctly fatal to
a premature or to a belated move on their part, and
even should they chance to strike upon the most
favourable moment, the horse-gathering policy militates
strongly against any likelihood of eventual
success. Should the malcontents determine to proceed
with the affair in the face of this discouragement,
they, of course, follow the lead of the Government,
and endeavour to annex all the mounts that the
authorities have been unable to carry off in time.</p>

<p>So far as the militant programme of the revolutionists
is concerned, the first sign of an outbreak
is invariably the riding away of a number of men
from townships and estancias to the woods in
the remoter and more lonely districts. These
sylvan rendezvous are, of course, known to the party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
in general beforehand, and here the leaders of the
movement lie hidden in order to await the advent
of reinforcements. The first move is simple enough;
but it is the arrival of the necessary reinforcements
that is frequently frustrated by the precautionary
measures of the Government.</p>

<p>Should the matter appear quite hopeless, it is
even then possible for the insurrectionists to disperse
and to return to their homes ere the shedding of
blood has occurred. The Uruguayan, however, is not
noted without reason for his spirit of reckless daring.
It frequently happens that a forlorn band, once
gathered, will refuse to disperse, and then the result
of the campaign is usually short and sharp. In the
ordinary course of events the adventurers will lie
hidden until a sufficient force has come in, one by
one, or in parties of three and four. Then they
will ride out and commence active operations,
of which the end in these days is invariably the
defeat of the party.</p>

<p>Many of the attributes of these revolutions are
not a little quaint and picturesque&mdash;reminiscent, in
fact, of the times when personality counted more
and system less. In the remote country districts,
more especially in those of the north, are many
prominent men who occupy more or less the position
of chieftains, or that of the old Caudillos who have
left so great a mark on Uruguayan history. Each of
these is a power in himself, according to the extent
of his following; for each can count upon his own
particular body of armed men just as surely as could
the feudal knights upon their mediæval retainers.
These personalities are naturally marked, and their
movements are closely watched in a period of unrest.</p>

<p>A Uruguayan revolution, even when in full blast,
has this to be said in its favour, that it does not
in the least interfere with the liberty or with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
movements of a resident foreigner. If he be an
estanciero, however, and should the tide of campaign
flow into his district, it is likely enough that it will
affect him materially in much the same fashion that
a strike influences the fortunes of dwellers in
industrial districts. It is obvious enough that when
the Government is in need of recruits the claims
of neither the pastures nor the shearing-shed can
rival those of the cause. Unfortunately for the
estanciero, there is almost certainly not a man in his
employ who is not admirably adapted for a trooper,
and none are more alive to this fact than the Government
recruiting-officers. Thus, when the official party
arrives its members will be polite but firm, and a
short while afterwards the station hands will be
bearing rifles instead of lassos, and a <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">capataz</i> or two&mdash;the
foremen on the estate&mdash;will find their heads
raised a little higher in the air beneath the support
of a military title, although it is possible that this
may be effected a little at the expense of their pockets,
since the pay is not in proportion to the temporary
rank.</p>

<p>In the circumstances of haste that obtain at such
moments it may be imagined that, with the exception
of the Government regular forces, the equipment
on both sides knows little of the accepted insignia
of military pomp. Indeed, a rifle and a badge in the
majority of cases alone distinguish the militant from
the ordinary civilian. But at such periods it must
be admitted that, putting aside the foreigners, very
few ordinary civilians are left in the disturbed areas,
since, when the tide of warfare rolls his way, it is
practically impossible for an Oriental to remain
neutral. Even were he so inclined, it is doubtful
whether he would be given the opportunity.</p>

<p>In order to obtain an insight into the manner in
which the actual hostilities are conducted no better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
means could be adopted than the perusal of a novel,
"The Purple Land that England Lost," from the
pen of a great authority on the River Plate, Mr.
W. H. Hudson. It is true that the descriptions deal
with a period when the present prosperity of the
Banda Oriental had not yet come into existence; but
the vivid local colouring must hold good for all the
contemporary softening of the national methods.</p>

<p>The spirit of modernism that is now evident in
Uruguay has entered to a certain extent into the
waging of these internal struggles that themselves by
rights should belong to the past. The Oriental is
perfectly willing to acknowledge that the dispute
concerns himself alone, and the tendency to localise
the fields of strife and to respect private property
is becoming more and more marked. A certain
amount of inevitable damage, however, ensues. In
districts where fuel is scarce fence-posts and even
railway-sleepers are apt to be employed for the
purpose of the camp fires.</p>

<p>So far as the parties themselves are concerned, the
tenacity of the Uruguayan character is clearly
evidenced in the continued struggles of the Blancos.
In view of the fact that this party has not been in
office since 1864, it might be thought that forty-seven
years of unsuccessful attempts would have cured
it of an ambition that has been so costly both in life
and purse. Nevertheless, whether openly or covertly,
the contest continues with much the same amount
of bitterness that characterised it from the start.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, it may be said that the Colorado
party is made up of the dwellers in the towns and
more populous centres, while the Blancos are represented
to a large extent by the dwellers in the Campo
and the clerical party. Of course, no hard-and-fast
rule can be laid down on the subject: there are
Blancos in plenty to be met with in the towns, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
numbers of the opposing section to be found
in the country; but in the main the distinction
applies.</p>

<p>The districts in which the Blancos are most strongly
represented of all are those of the northern provinces
of Tacuarembó and Rivera, more especially the latter,
since it offers in case of need the refuge of the
Brazilian frontier. Party feeling at all times runs
high, and in these districts that are almost altogether
given over to the Blanco cause a certain amount
of caution is necessary should a revolution actually
be in progress. Much stress, for instance, is laid
on the insignia that&mdash;in the absence of regular
military uniforms&mdash;distinguish the adherents of one
side from those of the other. In a Blanco district,
when trouble is seething, it may be laid
down as a hard-and-fast maxim that the traveller
should wear no trace of red about his person.
The precaution may seem grotesque, yet many
ludicrous mistakes have occurred through a failure
to observe it.</p>

<p>One of the numerous instances of the kind was
provided me by a mining engineer, who had himself
undergone the experience. Appointed as manager
to a goldmine in the far north of the Republic, he
happened to arrive, a stranger to the country, during
the period of unrest in 1904. Nearing his destination,
he had left the railway-line, and was completing the
last few leagues of his journey by coach, when he
stopped for refreshment at a small <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pulperia</i>, or rural
inn.</p>

<p>The place was fairly well filled with <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">peones</i>, and
with the various types of the local labourer, and
no sooner had he entered the doors than it became
obvious to the traveller that his advent had caused a
deep sensation amongst these folk. The landlord
served him with reluctance and a visible show of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
embarrassment, while the black looks of the rest
grew deeper, until the demeanour of a certain number
became actually threatening. The mining engineer
turned in amazement to the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">pulpero</i>, who in mute
accusation pointed a finger at the tie he wore. It
was a vivid red! The traveller had learned sufficient
of the country's situation to enable him to understand
something of the situation. The group of Blancos
were fully under the impression that one of their
hated political enemies had defiantly come to beard
them in their very midst. Explanations produced
only a minor result, since these hardy dwellers in the
back-blocks were wont to judge by deeds rather
than by words. So, perceiving that no other remedy
remained, the wearer of the hated badge hurried out
to his coach, unstrapped one of his bags, and entered
the pulperia once more, bearing beneath his collar a
standard of neutrality and peace in the shape of a
black tie! On this the local patrons of the inn
expressed their entire satisfaction, and profound
peace reigned in the pulperia.</p>

<p>It would be possible to mention a number of
similar episodes. There have even been cases when
the colouring of surveyor's poles has given an unpleasantly
political significance to instruments that
were never more misjudged. But even such ludicrous
side-issues serve to show the amount of bitterness that
exists amongst the humblest members of either cause.
Such determined struggles, it is true, are not a little
eloquent of the virility and energy of a nation.
Nevertheless, it will be a bright day for Uruguay
when the country can look upon its revolutions as
past history. As I have said elsewhere, these minor
wars have not succeeded in arresting the forward
march of the Republic. Yet their cessation could
not fail to produce an even greater acceleration in
the present rate of progress. Since every thoughtful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
Uruguayan admits this to the full, and openly
deplores these periodical outbursts of unrest, it is
to be hoped that the days of internal peace will not
be much longer delayed.</p>
